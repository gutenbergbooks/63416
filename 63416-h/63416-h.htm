second Appendix, descriptions of all the species discovered in
Britain since 1865, so far as they relate to the Orders included
in this volume. The success which has attended the sale of this
Work, and the number of fresh observers it has brought into the
field, has greatly tended to the necessity for a second Appendix.
A larger number of observers, over a still more extended area,
will, it is hoped, add further to our list; by increasing the
number of known species. Hitherto one great cause of the
paucity of students of Fungi in this country, especially of the
Microscopic forms, has been the want of text-books on the subject,
containing descriptions of the species, with figures illustrative
of the genera. Although this little volume only partly
supplies that want, by including the species found on living
plants alone, it has already proved of service; this and its
companion volume, “Introduction to British Fungi,” being
(with but one exception) the only books on Fungi which have
passed into a second edition in this country; a fact which
appears to prove that they have succeeded in furnishing a
desideratum, and in giving an impetus to the study. It is
hoped that similar results will follow the publication of this
new edition.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>IN these latter days, when everyone who possesses
a love for the marvellous, or desires a knowledge
of some of the minute mysteries of nature, has,
or ought to have, a microscope, a want is occasionally
felt which we have essayed to supply.
This want consists in a guide to some systematic
botanical study, in which the microscope can be
rendered available, and in which there is ample
field for discovery, and ample opportunity for the
elucidation of facts only partly revealed. Fungi,
especially the more minute epiphyllous species,
present just such an opportunity as many an
ardent student would gladly take advantage of;
one great obstacle to the pursuit being hitherto
found in the absence of any hand-book to this
section of the British Flora, embracing the emendations,
improvements, and additions of the past
twenty-seven years (the period at which the fifth
volume of the “English Flora” made its appearance).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>It would be incompatible with our object,
and beyond our limits, to introduce an entire
mycological flora to our readers in these pages;
but we hope to communicate such information as
will serve to prepare the way still more for such
an additional Flora, should it ever be produced,
and render the demand still wider and more
general for such an extension of our botanical
literature. It is true that one work has of late
years issued from the press on this subject, but
notwithstanding its utility to scientific men as a
record of species, it is practically useless to those
we address, from the absence of all specific descriptions
of microscopic fungi.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let not the reader imagine, from what we have
just stated, that it is our intention to burden him
with a dry series of botanical descriptions; as much
of this as we deem essential to render the book
available to the botanical student, we have preferred
to add in the form of an Appendix. Useful
as these may be to some, we hope to be enabled
to furnish for others something more; and
although we at once disclaim any intention of
including all the microscopic, or even the epiphytal
fungi, in our observations, yet we trust, by a selection
of common and typical species for illustration,
and by an adherence to certain well-defined groups
and sections, to demonstrate that the microscopist
will find an eligible field for his observations in
this direction, and the botanical student may gain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>some knowledge of their generic and specific distinctions.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is exceedingly difficult to give a logical definition
of what constitutes a fungus. It is no less
difficult to furnish a popular description which shall
include all and nothing more. If, for example, we
particularize the spots and markings on the leaves
and stems of herbaceous plants, so commonly met
with from early spring till the fall of the last leaf,
and even amongst the dead and decaying remains
of the vegetation of the year, we may include also
such spots and marks as result from insect depredations
or diseased tissue. It is not always easy,
with a cursory observation under the microscope,
to determine whether some appearances are produced
by fungi, insects, or organic disease: experience
is the safest guide, and until we acquire that
we shall occasionally fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we take a stroll away from the busy haunts of
men, though only for a short distance,—say, for
example (if from London), down to New Cross,—and
along the slopes of the railway cutting, we
shall be sure to find the plant called the goatsbeard
(<i>Tragopogon pratensis</i>) in profusion. In May or
June the leaves and unopened involucres of this
plant will present a singular appearance, as if
sprinkled with gold-dust, or rather, being deficient
in lustre, seeming as though some fairy folk had
scattered over them a shower of orange-coloured
chrome or turmeric powder. Examine this singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>phenomenon more closely, and the poetry about
the pixies all vanishes; for the orange powder will
be seen to have issued from the plant itself. A
pocket lens, or a Coddington, reveals the secret of
the mysterious dust. Hundreds of small orifices
like little yellow cups, with a fringe of white teeth
around their margins, will be seen thickly scattered
over the under surface of the leaves. These cups
(called <i>peridia</i>) will appear to have burst through
the epidermis of the leaf and elevated themselves
above its surface, with the lower portion attached
to the substratum beneath. In the interior of
these cup-like excrescences, or <i>peridia</i>, a quantity
of the orange-coloured spherical dust remains,
whilst much of it has been shed and dispersed over
the unoccupied portions of the leaves, the stems,
and probably on the leaves of the grass or other
plants growing in its immediate vicinity. These
little cups are fungi, the yellow dust the spores,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
or ultimate representatives of seed, and the epiphytal
plants we have here found we will accept
as the type of the group or order to which we
wish to direct attention (<a href='#i004'>Plate I.</a> figs. 1-3).</p>
<div id='i004'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Plate I.<br />W. West imp.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='footnote c019' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Protospores they should be called, because, in fact, they
germinate, and on the threads thus produced the true spores,
or fruit, are borne.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the six families into which fungi are
divided, is one in which the spores are the principal
feature, as is the aurantiaceous dust in the
parasite of the goatsbeard. This family is named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><i>Coniomycetes</i>, from two Greek words, meaning
“dust-fungi.” This group or family includes
several smaller groups, termed orders, which are
analogous to the natural orders of flowering plants.
Without staying to enumerate the characteristics
of these orders, we select one in which the spores
are enclosed in a distinct peridium, as in our typical
plant they are contained within the cups. This
order is the <i>Æcidiacei</i>, so called after <i>Æcidium</i>, the
largest and most important of the genera included
within this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>Æcidiacei</i> are always developed on living
plants, sometimes on the flowers, fruit, petioles, or
stems, but most commonly on the leaves: occasionally
on the upper surface, but generally on the
inferior. The different species are distributed over
a wide area; many are found in Europe and North
America, some occur in Asia, Africa, and Australia.
When the cryptogamic plants of the world shall
have been as widely examined and as well understood
as the phanerogamic plants have been, we
shall be in a better position to determine the
geographical distribution of the different orders of
fungi. In the present incomplete state of our
knowledge, all such efforts will be unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to return to the goatsbeard, and its cluster-cups.
The little fungus is called <i>Æcidium tragopogonis</i>,
the first being the name of the genus, and
the last that of the species. Let us warn the young
student against falling into the error of supposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>because in this, and many other instances, the
specific name of the fungus is derived from the
plant, or one of the plants, upon which it is found,
that therefore the species differs with that of the
plant, and that, as a rule, he may anticipate meeting
with a distinct species of fungus on every
distinct species of plant, or that the parasite which
he encounters on the living leaves of any one plant
is <i>necessarily</i> specifically distinct from those found
on all other plants. One species of <i>Æcidium</i>, for
instance, may hitherto have been found only on one
species of plant, whereas another <i>Æcidium</i> may
have been found on five or six different species of
plants. The mycologist will look to the specific
differences in the parasite without regard to the
identity or distinctness of the plant upon which it
is parasitic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the <i>Æcidium</i> breaks through the epidermis,
the under surface of the leaves of the
goatsbeard will appear to be covered with little
elevations or pustules, paler at the apex; these
soon become ruptured, and the fungus pushes its
head through the opening, at the same time
bursting by radiating fissures. The teeth thus
formed resemble those of the peristome of some
mosses. All around the orifice of the peridium
the teeth become recurved, and the orange spores
are exposed, crowded together within. At first,
and while contained within the peridium, these
spores are concatenate or chained together, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>when dispersed they are scattered singly about the
orifice, often mixed with the colourless cells arising
from the partial breaking up of the teeth of the
peridium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us pause for a moment in our examination of
the individual cups, to ascertain their manner of
distribution over the leaves. In this instance they
are scattered without any apparent order over the
under surface, but generally thickest towards the
summit of the leaves; occasionally a few are met
with on the upper surface. Sometimes two or
three touch at the margins, but we have never
met with them truly confluent; generally there is
a space greater than the width of the cups around
each, the stratum or subiculum from whence they
arise is scarcely thickened, and there are no spots
or indications on the opposite surface. If a leaf
be taken fresh and the cuticle stripped off, which
it will sometimes do very readily, the orifices
through which the <i>Æcidium</i> has burst will appear
in irregular holes. If a section be made of one or
two of the fungi <i>in situ</i>, they will be seen to
spring from beneath the cuticle, the peridium to
be simple, and rounded at the base, the spores
clustered at the bottom, and the fringe to be a
continuation of its cellular substance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spores in this species are orange, subglobose,
sometimes angular, and indeed very variable
both in size and form, though the majority are
comparatively large. Each of these bodies is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>doubtless, capable of reproducing its species, and
if we compute 2,000 cluster-cups as occurring on
each leaf, and we have found half as many more on
an ordinary-sized leaf, and suppose each cup to
contain 250,000 spores, which again is below the
actual number, then we shall have not less than
five hundred millions of reproductive bodies on
one leaf of the goatsbeard to furnish a crop of
parasites for the plants of the succeeding year.
We must reckon by millions, and our figures and
faculties fail in appreciating the myriads of spores
which compose the orange dust produced upon one
infected cluster of plants of <i>Tragopogon</i>. Nor is
this all, for our number represents only the actual
protospores which are contained within the peridia;
each of these on germination may produce not
only one but many vegetative spores, which are
exceedingly minute, and, individually, may be
regarded as embryos of a fresh crop of cluster-cups.
And this is not the only enemy of the kind
to which this unfortunate plant is subject, for
another fungus equally prolific often takes possession
of the interior of the involucre wherein the
young florets are hid, and converts the whole into
a mass of purplish black spores even more minute
than those of the <i>Æcidium</i>, and both these parasites
will be occasionally found flourishing on the
same plant at the same time (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> figs. 92-94).</p>

<p class='c008'>Naturally enough, our reader will be debating
within himself how these spores, which we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>seen, are shed in such profusion, can enter the
tissues of the plants which give subsequent
evidence of infection; in fact, how the yellow
dust with which the goatsbeard of to-day is
covered will inoculate the young plants of next
year. If one or two of these spores are sprinkled
upon the piece of the cuticle which we have
recommended to be removed from the leaf for
examination, it will be seen that they are very
much larger than the stomata or breathing-pores
which stud the cuticle: hence it is clear that they
cannot gain admittance there. There remains but
one other portal to the interior of the plant—namely,
the spongioles, or extremities of the roots.
Here another difficulty arises; for the spores are
as large as the cells through which they have to
pass. This difficulty may be lessened when we
remember that what are termed the spores which
are discharged from the cups are not the true
spores, but bodies from which smaller seed-like
vesicles are produced; yet, even then there will
be much need of an active imagination to invent
hypotheses to cover the innumerable difficulties
which would encounter their passage through the
vessels of the infected plants. The Rev. M. J.
Berkeley proved many years ago that the spores of
bunt, for example, may be caused to infect all the
plants the seeds of which had been placed in
contact with them; but this affection did not
necessarily accrue from the absorption of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>spores, or the ultimate sporidia produced after
three or four generations. It is possible that the
granular or fluid contents of the spores may be
absorbed by the plant, and as a result of this
absorption, become inoculated with the virus,
which at length breaks out in fungoid growths.
Much has been done to elucidate this mystery of
inoculation, but much also remains a mystery still.
There is no doubt that the inoculation takes place
at an early age,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> probably in the seeds of many
plants; in others it may be conveyed with the
moisture to the roots; but the spores themselves
have certainly not yet been traced traversing the
tissues of growing plants.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. de Bary has lately shown that in many similar instances
the seed-leaves are inoculated. It will be necessary to refer
more particularly to his experiments hereafter.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>If, instead of going in search of goatsbeard and
its attendant fungus, we turn our steps northward
and enter one of the Highgate or Hampstead
woods, where the pretty little wood-anemone
(<i>Anemone nemorosa</i>) flourishes abundantly, and
turn up the radical leaves, one by one, and examine
their under-surfaces, we shall at length be rewarded
by finding one covered with similar
cluster-cups to those we have been describing as
occurring on the goatsbeard, but far less commonly.
Leaf after leaf will be found covered with the
brown spots of another fungus called <i>Puccinia
anemones</i>, with which nearly every plant will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>more or less infected in the spring of the year;
and at length, if we persevere, the anemone
cluster-cup (<i>Æcidium leucospermum</i>) will be our
reward (<a href='#i004'>Plate I.</a> figs. 4-6). The specific name
will suggest one point of difference between the
two fungi, as in this instance the spores are white,
and somewhat elliptic. Probably this species is
not common, as we have found it but seldom,
though often in search of it. A nearly allied
species has been found on <i>Anemones</i> in gardens,
having but few large teeth about the orifice, though
not constantly four, as the name would indicate
(<i>Æ. quadrifidum</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>A walk through almost any wood, in the spring
of the year, will reward the mycologist with
another cluster-cup (<i>Æcidium</i>), in which the
peridia are scattered over the whole surface of
the leaf. This will be found on the wood spurge,
giving a sickly yellowish appearance to the leaves,
on the under surface of which it is found. By
experience one may soon learn to suspect the
occurrence of parasites of this nature on leaves,
from the peculiar exhausted and unhealthy appearance
which they assume as the spores ripen, and
which will spare the labour of turning over the
leaves when there are no distinct spots on the
upper surface. <i>Æ. Euphorbiæ</i> is found on several
species of <i>Euphorbium</i> or spurge, but we have
always found it most abundantly on the wood
spurge in the Kentish woods between Dartford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and Gravesend. The spores in this species are
orange, and externally it bears considerable resemblance
to the goatsbeard cluster-cup, but the
spores are rather smaller and paler, the teeth
are less distinct and persistent, the subiculum is
more thickened, and the peridia are more densely
crowded.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another group of species belonging to
the same genus of fungi in which the arrangement
of the peridia is different. One of the first
of our native wild flowers, in making its appearance
after the departure of frost and snow, is the
little yellow celandine (<i>Ranunculus ficaria</i>).</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ere a leaf is on the bush,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>And one of the earliest parasitic fungi in spring is
an <i>Æcidium</i> which flourishes on its glossy leaves.
So common is <i>Æcidium ranunculacearum</i> on this
species of <i>Ranunculus</i>, that it can scarcely have
escaped the eye of any one who has taken the
trouble to examine the plant. It appears in patches
on the under surface of the leaves or on their
petioles, in the latter case swelling and distorting
them. Sometimes these patches are nearly circular,
at others of very irregular form, and varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>in size from less than one-twelfth of an inch to half
an inch in diameter. It is found on several species
of <i>Ranunculus</i>, as <i>R. acris</i>, <i>bulbosus</i>, and <i>repens</i>, but
most commonly on <i>R. ficaria</i>. The leaf is thickened
at the spot occupied by the parasite, and generally
without indication on the opposite surface. Sometimes
one spot, at others several, occur on the
same leaf. The peridia are densely crowded together,
often arranged in a circinate manner, <i>i.e.</i>,
like a watch-spring, or the young frond of a fern.
The spores are orange, but slightly varying in tint
on different species of <i>Ranunculus</i> (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> figs.
12-14). One of the smaller clusters, when collected
before the spores are dispersed, or the teeth
of the peridium discoloured, mounted dry as an
opaque object, makes a very excellent slide for an
inch or half-inch objective; and the same may be
said of many others of the same genus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Less common than the foregoing is the species
of <i>Æcidium</i> which attacks the violet. The sweetest
of flowers as well as the earliest, in despite both of
its odour and its humility, becomes a victim to one
or more of the ubiquitous race of fungi. Thickened
spots at first appear on the leaves; the petioles, or
flower stem, or even the calyx, become swollen
and distorted; and at length the cluster-cup breaks
through. The spots on the leaves upon which the
peridia are scattered are yellowish, generally larger
than the clusters on the pilewort, and seldom with
more than one spot on each leaf. The peridia, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>cups, are irregularly distributed over the spots, not
crowded together as in the last species; and the
teeth are large, white, and distinct. The spores
are at first orange, but at length become brownish.
This species may be found in spring, as late as
June, most commonly on the dog-violet, but also
on other species of <i>Viola</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not a very desirable occupation to search a
bed of nettles, and turn over the individual leaves
to look for minute fungi. A very pretty <i>Æcidium</i>
is nevertheless far from uncommon in such a habitat.
Fortunately it occurs very often on the petioles of
the leaves and on the stem, distorting them very
much; and in such situations flourishing, apparently,
more vigorously than when occupying the under surface
of the leaves (<a href='#i004'>Plate I.</a> fig. 10). In the latter
situation the clusters of peridia are small, seldom
exceeding a dozen in a spot, but several spots may
be found on the same leaf. On the stem they are
clustered around for upwards of an inch in length,
and their bright orange colour in such a situation
renders them very conspicuous objects. The peridia
are always closely packed together upon a thickened
base, and offer but slight variations from the forms
already enumerated, save that they widen slightly
at the mouth, so as to become nearly campanulate.
The spores are orange, and very profuse.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the past summer we noticed, for the first
time, a very pretty little species of cluster-cup
(<i>Æcidium</i>) on the wood sanicle (<i>Sanicula Europæa</i>) in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Darenth wood. It was far from uncommon, and we
believe it to be specifically distinct from its nearest
ally, found on the earthnut leaves, and those of some
other umbelliferous plants. The little cups are in
small clusters of four or five together, on the under
surface and on the petioles; they are small, but
the teeth are relatively large, white, and distinct.
The spores are of a pallid, yellowish colour, and not
so profuse as in the last species. A darker spot on
the upper surface of the leaf generally indicates
their presence. This species was found many years
ago by Carmichael at Appin, and called by him
<i>Æcidium saniculæ</i>; but we find no notice of its
occurrence since, though it seems to be far from
uncommon at Darenth, and probably elsewhere,
should the sanicle be common also.</p>

<p class='c008'>Recently we found the bedstraw cluster-cup
(<i>Æcidium galii</i>) on the great hedge bedstraw
(<i>Galium mollugo</i>), and as it has not been figured
before, we have included it amongst our illustrations
(<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> figs. 15-17). Though very insignificant
when occurring on the small leaves of the
yellow bedstraw (<i>Galium verum</i>), it is a prominent
object on the above-named species.</p>

<p class='c008'>We received, for the first time, in July, 1864,
from Mr. Gatty, student at Winchester, a portion
of a plant of <i>Thesium humifusum</i> (which is by no
means common in Britain), covered with beautiful
cluster-cups of a species never before recorded as
occurring in this country (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> figs. 50, 51)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>named <i>Æcidium Thesii</i>, but which is far from uncommon
on the Continent. It occurred in this instance
on the Downs, in the vicinity of Winchester.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is unnecessary here to refer to other allied
species of <i>Æcidium</i>, except one to be presently
noticed, since we have, at the end of
the volume, enumerated and given descriptions
of all the species hitherto found in Britain.
Suffice it to say that the Buckthorn cluster-cups
on the alder buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus frangula</i>),
is usually very common in the Highgate
and Hornsey woods, and on the common buckthorn
(<i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>) in the neighbourhood
of Dartford, in Kent. That on the honeysuckle we
have found but very rarely. On the gooseberry
and red-currant leaves, commonly in some years
and rarely in others; whilst a few of those described
we have never collected. The species on
different composite plants is subject to great variation,
and on most may be found in the autumn;
one variety only, on the leaves of <i>Lapsana communis</i>,
we have met with in the spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very few years ago farmers generally believed
that the cluster-cups of the berberry (<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>),
were productive of mildew in corn grown
near them; this opinion even received the support
of Sir J. Banks, but no fungi can be much more
distinct than those found on corn crops and this
species on the leaves of the berberry. In this
instance the cups are much elongated, and cylindrical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the clusters vary much in size, and the spots
on the upper surface of the leaf are reddish, bright,
and distinct. The teeth are white and brittle, and
the orange spores copious (<a href='#i004'>Plate I.</a> figs. 7-9).</p>

<p class='c008'>There are scarcely any of the epiphyllous fungi
forming equally handsome or interesting objects
for low powers of the microscope, than the genus
to which attention has just been directed; and they
possess the advantage of being readily found, for
that locality must be poor indeed which cannot
furnish six species during the year. We have
found half of the number of described species
within little more than walking distance of the
metropolis, within a period of little more than
three months, and should be glad to hear of the
occurrence of any of the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have three species of fungi very similar in
many respects to the foregoing, but differing in
others to such an extent as to justify their association
under a different genus and name. The
hawthorn is a bush familiar to all who love the
“merry month of May,” but it may be that its
parasite has been unnoticed by thousands. If, for
the future, our readers will bear this subject in their
minds when they stand beneath a hawthorn hedge,
they may become acquainted with clusters of singular
brown pustules on the leaves, petioles, and
fruit well worthy of more minute examination (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a>
fig. 22). They scarcely claim the name of cups,
and their lacerated and fringed margins rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>resemble the pappus crowning the fruits of some
composite plants than the cups of <i>Æcidium</i>. The
peridia are very long, and split down throughout
their length into thread-like filaments of attached
cells; these gradually fall away and break up into
their component parts till but short portions
remain attached to the base of the peridia. These
cells are elongated and marked on the surface with
waved lines, forming in themselves pretty objects for
a high power of the microscope (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> figs. 23, 24).
If the teeth of <i>Æcidium</i> resemble the peristome of
some mosses, such as <i>Splachnum</i>; the threads of
this species of <i>Rœstelia</i>, except in not being twisted,
somewhat resemble the peristomes of other mosses
of the genus <i>Tortula</i>. The spores in this species
are less conspicuous, being of a light brown, and
the whole plant, from its modest hue, may be
readily passed over without attracting attention
unless occurring in abundance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leaves of pear-trees afford a second species
of this genus sufficiently distinct to commend it to
our notice. Sometimes it is very common, at others
but few examples are to be met with. The clusters
occur on the under surface, and consist of half-a-dozen
or less of large peridia, pointed at the apex
and swelling in the middle so as to become urn-shaped
(<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> figs. 20, 21). These vessels or
thecæ split into numerous threads or laciniæ, which
remain united together at the apex. Like the
species already noticed, this is brown and inconspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>except on account of its size, for it is the
largest of all that we have had occasion to notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third species occurs on the under surface
of the leaves of the mountain-ash. The peridia
are clustered on a rusty orange-coloured spot
which is visible on the upper surface (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a>
figs. 18, 19). They are long and cylindrical, with
an evident tendency to curvature; the mouth is
serrated, but not split up into threads, as in the
species found on the hawthorn. There will often
be found instead of well-developed peridia, what at
one time were regarded as abortive peridia, forming
a thickened orange or rust-coloured spot, studded
with minute elevated points. These spots are
clusters of spermogones, which organs are described
in detail in our second chapter. The clusters and
spores are of a brighter reddish-brown than in
either of the other species. All are remarkably
distinct, and perhaps the most curious and interesting
of any that we have passed in review. To
botanists, the species found on the hawthorn is
known as <i>Rœstelia lacerata</i>, that on pear-leaves as
<i>Rœstelia cancellata</i>, and the one on the leaves of
the mountain-ash as <i>Rœstelia cornuta</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Withering observed the spore-spots on the
leaves of the mountain-ash, but was evidently
puzzled to account for them. He writes (in his
Arrangement of British Plants), “The spots on
the leaves of <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> consist of minute
globules intermixed with wool-like fibres. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>examining many of them in different states, I at
length found a small maggot in some of the
younger spots, so that the globules are probably
its excrement, and the fibres, the woody fibres of
the plant unfit for its food.” We now-a-days smile
at such simple and singular conjectures. It affords
evidence of the manner in which the speculations of
one generation become follies in the next.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only two species of cluster-cups are described in
Withering’s Flora under the genus <i>Lycoperdon</i>:
one of these is now called <i>Æcidium compositarum</i>,
and is found on various composite plants; the other
includes the species found on the wood-anemone
and that on the moschatel, and also probably a
species of <i>Puccinia</i> on the wood-betony.</p>

<p class='c008'>To render this chapter more complete, though of
less importance to the microscopist, we may allude
to the other two genera comprised within this order.
<i>Peridermium</i> is the name of one genus which
contains two British species found on the leaves
and young shoots of coniferous trees. In this
genus the peridium bursts irregularly, and does not
form cups, or horns, or fringed vessels. The most
common species is found on the needle-shaped
leaves of the Scotch fir (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> fig. 27), and also
on the young twigs, in the latter instance larger
and more prominent than in the former. The
elongated peridia burst irregularly at their apices
without forming teeth (fig. 28).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the genus <i>Endophyllum</i>, as its name implies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the peridium is imbedded within the substance
of the succulent leaves. The only species we
possess is found rarely upon the common house-leek.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have derived much pleasure in viewing the
astonishment and delight exhibited by friends to
whom we have personally communicated specimens
of the little fungi we have enumerated for examination
under the microscope; and we recommend
with confidence this group of parasitic plants,
unfortunately so little known, as well worthy of the
attention of all who are interested in the minute
aspects of nature, and who can recognize the
hand—</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>IN addition to their spore-bearing spots, lichens
have for some time been known to possess other
organs, termed <i>spermogones</i>, which are probably
concerned more or less in the reproductive process.
The first intimation of the existence of
similar bodies in the entophytal fungi originated
with M. Unger in 1833, but it was left to Dr. de
Bary and the Messrs. Tulasne, twenty years later,
to examine and determine satisfactorily the nature
and value of the spermogones of the Uredines.
It was at first believed that the smaller pustules—which
sometimes precede, and sometimes accompany,
the cluster-cups and some other allied fungi—were
distinct species developed simultaneously
therewith, or members of a new genus, which,
under the name of <i>Æcidiolum exanthematum</i>, found
a place in the mycologic system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without staying to trace the stages through
which the elucidation of their true nature proceeded,
it will suffice for our purpose to tell what
is now known of these secondary organs; to
accomplish which we must stand greatly indebted
to the independent researches of Messrs. de Bary
and Tulasne. It has been demonstrated that both
these bodies, namely, the primary organs or cluster-cups,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and the secondary organs or spermogones,
are developed from the same mycelium; but the
value of the latter is still undetermined. If they
possess any fecundative power, the process has not
been traced; or if they are in themselves reproductive,
they have not at present been seen to
germinate. Their uses, therefore, in the economy
of the parasitic plant of which they are now known
to form a part is still a mystery, and they remain
valueless in the determination of genera and
species. Any speculation which might regard
them as male organs would be premature, and
without support in fact. Hitherto only some
species of the genera described in the foregoing
chapter, and others belonging to genera not
hitherto named, have been ascertained to possess
spermogones. Of the former are the <i>Rœsteliæ</i>,
some species of <i>Æcidium</i>, as those of <i>Euphorbia</i>,
&amp;c., and <i>Peridermium Pini</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>These spermogones are of a very simple structure—very
delicate, indeed; so much so, that they
will scarcely bear preparation for demonstration.
De Bary states that they originate from plain,
delicate, inarticulate threads, about half the thickness
of the mycelium (the root-like branching
fibres which form the fundamental stratum of
fungoid growths), which are developed in large
quantities, and closely packed together. These
threads are compacted together so as to form an
outer enveloping integument or peridium, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>either globular or hemispherical (or in some instances
elongated), more or less immersed, and at
length opening at the apex (fig. 153) by a regularly
formed minute ostiolum. The inner wall of
the peridium is covered with a thick forest of
simple filaments standing on end. From the
summit of these filaments or sterigmata, the
spermatia are borne. These are either isolated or
associated together in strings or chaplets, are
exceedingly minute, of an ovoid or oblong shape,
and are produced in such numbers as to fill the
cavity of the spermogone. Besides these, a viscid
fluid is secreted, in which the spermatia are immersed,
and which is expelled with them from the
orifice of the peridium. According to the density
of this fluid, or the hygrometric state of the atmosphere,
it appears sometimes in drops, and sometimes
oozing out in threads or cirrhi from the
spermogones. To compare minute things with
gigantic, as a recent author has observed, it
resembles the lava issuing from the crater of a
volcano. The colour of this spermatiferous matter
is commonly orange, but in some instances brown,
though not constantly of the same colour as the
spores produced from the same mycelium. This
gelatinous substance is dissolved away from the
granular bodies which are immersed in it, by
adding a little water upon the slide on which the
mass is placed for examination. The granules, or
spermatia, then exhibit those peculiar movements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>which have been observed in the similar bodies in
lichens, and fitly described as “a sort of oscillating
motion, as of a body attached at one extremity.”
The cause of this motion is at present uncertain,
vibratile ciliæ, to which similar movements are
referred, being altogether absent; but probably,
as De Bary believes, the cause may be found in
the influence of exosmose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The largest spermatia yet examined (those of
<i>Peridermium Pini</i>) have a length equal to 1/2500 of
an inch, but their width seldom exceeds 1/100000 of
an inch, whilst in others their length does not
exceed the width of those just named.</p>

<p class='c008'>Messrs. Tulasne affirm that all these corpuscles,
as well as the mucilaginous fluid, evolve an appreciable
odour, resembling that of the pollen of the
willow. M. Léveillé compares the odour to that of
orange flowers, and M. de Bary to that of the
evening primrose.</p>

<p class='c023'>The spermogones do not always appear like
pustules on the surface of the leaves, for sometimes
their presence is only indicated by minute
depressed punctures which are scarcely visible;
generally, however, they may be recognized by an
obtuse, or otherwise a pointed, protuberance that
surmounts them. The margin of the orifice is
sometimes furnished with short hairs, but is more
frequently ornamented with a pencil of long hairs,
which are stiff and erect, and of the colour of the
enclosed spermatia.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>In many of the species of <i>Æcidium</i> the cups are
disposed in a more or less regular circle, the centre
of which is occupied by a group of spermogones; at
the same time, the corresponding spot on the
opposite surface of the leaf will frequently be found
also occupied by other spermogones—in some
instances in greater number than on the same surface
of the leaf on which the cups are seated. This is
the case in the <i>Æcidium</i> which is found upon the
leaves of the coltsfoot, and that of the honeysuckle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very bright orange-coloured spots may be observed
in autumn (we have encountered them often
in August and September) upon the leaves of pear
trees, and which are covered with little tubercles,
at first of the same colour, but ultimately becoming
brown. These pustules are so many spermogones
belonging to <i>Rœstelia cancellata</i>, a kind of cluster-cup
found in the same localities. These spots have
long since been noticed, and regarded as connected
with the <i>Rœstelia</i>, but in what manner has until
recently been unknown. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley
noticed them in the English Flora in 1836, or at least
the granulations on the upper surfaces of the leaves
bearing <i>R. cancellata</i>, <i>R. cornuta</i>, and <i>R. lacerata</i>,
and called them abortive pseudoperidia. Before this
(in 1804) they had been observed by Rebentisch.
An examination of one of these spots under a low
power of the microscope, and afterwards a section
of one or more of the pustules, cut with a sharp
razor, and viewed with a higher power, will give an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>idea of the nature of the bodies we are attempting
to describe. During the past summer we have
noticed very similar orange spots on leaves of the
berberry containing spermogones on both surfaces,
and these appeared before any cups had been found
on that plant. In this instance no cups were produced
from the spots on the leaves examined, and
which were carefully noticed at intervals until they
withered and fell.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some instances, as in <i>Rœstelia cornuta</i>, which
is found on the leaves of the mountain-ash, the
cups are produced on the lower, but the spermogones
almost exclusively on the upper surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spermogones of <i>Peridermium Pini</i> are white,
few in number, and are developed, not only in the
spring, but sometimes reappear in the autumn upon
the same leaves that produced them at the commencement
of the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such instances as those of the <i>Æcidium</i> of the
spurge, and also the goatsbeard, in which the
cluster-cups are arranged in no appreciable order,
the spermogones are scattered amongst them, and
even in some instances appear on different leaves.
The spermogones are common on the wood spurge
in spring, scattered over both surfaces of the leaves
before the cluster-cups make their appearance, and
gradually these latter are developed amongst them,
commencing from the apex of the leaves and proceeding
in the order of their development towards
the base. In this instance the spermogones are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>bright yellow, as are afterwards the cups and spores
of the <i>Æcidium</i>. In most instances the appearance
of the spermogones precedes that of the sporiferous
organs, but the latter follow sufficiently speedy for
perfect development before the decadence of the
spermogones takes place.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the expulsion of the spermatia and the fluid
which accompanies them, the whole mass dries up;
and where many spermogones have been clustered
together in the same spot a brown homogeneous
crust is formed upon the epidermis; where they are
produced singly, a brownish incrustation is visible
about the mouth of each spermogone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Re-agents applied to the spermogones whilst in
full vitality indicate the presence of a considerable
amount of a protein substance, which, with sugar
and sulphuric acid, produces a deep purple red colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>From what we have already stated of the method
of occurrence of these organs, the following is the
only order, apparently, preserved in their development,
although no definite rules can at present be
affirmed. The spore spots of cluster-cups are
generally found upon the under surfaces of the
leaves on which they are produced, and the spermogones
are most numerous on the upper. When
both the cluster-cups and the spermogones appear
in the same group on the same surface, the spermogones
commonly occupy the centre, and the
cups are arranged in a circular manner about
them. In other, and fewer instances, both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>organs stand together indiscriminately upon the
same surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spermogones are also developed centrifugally,
at least so far as at present observed, for
when they are produced in a cluster the central one
first opens and discharges its contents, and thus the
development proceeds outwards from the centre to
the circumference. When the spermogones are
scattered, as in those of <i>Euphorbia</i>, they are first
observed at the apex of the leaf, whence they are
developed in succession towards the base. The
latter should be sought for on the young plants of
the wood spurge in March or April, at which time
we have found them abundant at Darenth wood,
near Dartford.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must not be concluded, from the fact that we
have not yet adverted to spermogones in connection
with other fungi, that they are peculiar to the
<i>Æcidiacei</i>. Such is by no means the case. As we
have hereafter described other genera and species
in which spermogones occur, it would be out of
place to enter upon further details here. Let it
suffice therefore that we state that they have been
found in members of the genera, <i>Aregma</i>, <i>Triphragmium</i>,
<i>Puccinia</i>, <i>Lecythea</i>, <i>Trichobasis</i>, and <i>Uredo</i>,
but they have been found much more generally in
<i>Rœstelia</i> and <i>Æcidium</i> than in any other genus.</p>

<p class='c008'>As comparatively little is yet known of these
bodies, a fair field is open to the enterprising
microscopist, with time at his disposal, and a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>store of perseverance, to win for himself renown
in the discovery of fresh facts, and the elucidation
of some of the mysteries which yet enshroud these
interesting organisms. From the foregoing pages
he will learn the direction in which his researches
should tend, and he may be assured that every new
fact is of importance when carefully ascertained.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>BEFORE entering further and more fully upon
the subject of this volume, it may be advisable
to attempt an explanation of a phenomenon of no
uncommon occurrence in many groups of Fungi,
and which is termed <i>di-morphism</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Uredines, or uredo-like fungi, as well as
other of the <i>Coniomycetes</i> (in which the spores are
the principal feature), the same fungus appears
under two or more distinct forms, not necessarily
mere differences of age, but so distinct that they
have been regarded (and some are so still) as
different species belonging to different genera,
often far removed from each other, and bearing
different names. One plant, for instance, sprinkled
over the under surface of a rose-leaf, like turmeric
powder, has its mycelium, or root-like threads,
penetrating the tissue, whilst bearing above its
spherical golden-coloured spores. Its vegetative
system is complete, and, apparently, its reproductive
also; hence it seems to claim recognition as a
perfect plant, and under the name of <i>Uredo Rosæ</i>
was so recognized, until microscopical investigation
determined otherwise. Thus it has been discovered
that certain dark brown spots which appear later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in the season are produced upon the same mycelium,
and are indeed aggregations of more perfect and
complex fruits of the same plant. Before this
point was satisfactorily decided, the brown spores,
which are borne on long stalks, and are themselves
septate or divided (apparently or really) by transverse
partitions into a complex fruit, received
the name of <i>Puccinia Rosæ</i>. At this period, <i>Uredo
Rosæ</i> and <i>Puccinia Rosæ</i>, or the yellow fungus and
the dark brown fungus, were believed to be distinct
and different plants; now, on the contrary,
they are believed to be different forms of fruit
produced by the same plant; <i>i.e.</i>, an instance of
di-morphism. <i>Aregma mucronatum</i>, Fr., is the
present scientific name of what is regarded as the
perfect fungus, whilst the uredo-form either bears
the name of <i>Lecythea Rosæ</i>, Lev., or by some
mycologists is rejected altogether as a spurious
species.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the summer it is not uncommon to find
the leaves of some grasses, of the hop, of roses,
and many other plants, covered with a kind of
white mould, which appears under the microscope
as a multitude of small transparent colourless
cellules, generally attached to each other in a
moniliform or beaded manner. These moulds were
long known under the generic name of <i>Oidium</i>, to
which genus the vine disease was also referred.
More minute investigation and more careful
examination proved that these moulds were not in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>themselves perfect plants, but merely conditions of
other fungi of a higher order, little differing it is
true in external appearance to the naked eye, but
offering material differences in structure under the
microscope. Upon the white mould-like threads,
spherical bodies are produced in the autumn, containing
little sacs or asci filled with spores; and in
this condition the plants are arranged under the
genus <i>Erysiphe</i>, whilst the species of <i>Oidium</i> which
represented their imperfect condition, are excluded
from the system. Here, again, we have examples
of <i>di-morphism</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Journal of the Microscopical Society, Mr.
F. Currey has detailed several instances of di-morphism
which have fallen within his experience.
In one instance he has shown that a small simple
spored fungus, termed <i>Cryptosporium Neesii</i>, Ca.,
is only a state or condition of a fungus with compound
fruit, belonging to the <i>Sphœria</i> section of
ascigerous fungi, called <i>Valsa suffusa</i>, Fr. Both
plants are exactly alike externally, but the perithecium,
or flask-like receptacle containing the
fructification, in one instance only holds naked
spores, and in the other the spores are contained in
little elongated vesicular bags or asci, which are
packed within the perithecium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whilst writing this, one of the most wonderful
books in a book-producing age lies beside us; it
is the second volume of a work on fungi, by the
brothers Tulasne; and this, as well as its predecessor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>is devoted to this very subject of a multiplicity
of form in the fructification of these plants.
Illustrated by the most exquisite of engravings
which art has ever produced, it also unfolds many
a page in the history of these organisms, for which
mycologists were not altogether unprepared. In
noticing this work, one of our most eminent
authors on mycological subjects quotes as an
example <i>Dothidia ribis</i>, Fr., one of our most
common fungi, which occurs in the form of little
black shields on dead twigs of currants and goose-berries.
Here we have, he says, naked spores
(<i>conidia</i>) growing on the external cells of the
stroma; we have naked spores of a second kind
(<i>stylospores</i>) produced in distinct cysts (<i>pycnides</i>);
we have minute bodies of a third kind (<i>spermatia</i>)
produced again in distinct cysts, resembling very
closely similar bodies in lichens; and we have a
third kind of cysts, containing the usual sporidia
in sausage-shaped hyaline sacs (<i>asci</i>). Even here,
however, we have not done with marvels; for if
the stylospores are placed in water, they produce in
the course of twenty-four hours conidia of a second
order, exactly analogous to those which arise on
the germination of the spores of the rusts and
mildews which affect our cereals and other
plants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Further reference is also made to three species
of moulds, which M. Tulasne has shown to be only
varied forms of the mycelium of a species of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>Sphœria</i> common to various plants; these moulds
having been hitherto regarded as fungi perfect in
themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Uredines, to which much of this volume
is devoted, the genera known as <i>Lecythea</i> and
<i>Trichobasis</i> are by some mycologists excluded
altogether, as containing only species which are
mere forms of more highly-developed uredines,
such as <i>Puccinia</i>, <i>Aregma</i>, and others. On the
other hand, they are retained by those who possess
a lingering doubt whether both forms may not be
distinct, though developed from the same pustule.
As the two forms are distinct in appearance, it will
better answer our present purpose to treat them
separately, notwithstanding the belief that, in a
scientific point of view, the evidence is all in favour
of their union.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fungi of this kind the mycelium, or delicate
root-like threads, consists of thin filaments, which
are spread through all parts of the plant occupied
by the parasite, traversing the intercellular passages,
but rarely perforating and entering the cells.
This compacted and interwoven mycelium forms a
kind of cushion beneath each pustule, on which the
fruits of the parasite rest. By the increase of this
cushion and the swelling of the fruit, the epidermis
which covers them is distended, and ultimately
ruptured, so that, when ripened, the spores escape.
It must be remembered that the fruit is of from
two to four kinds. Small bodies, called <i>spermatia</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>which are derived from the spermogones, and
which have not yet been known to germinate;
<i>Stylospores</i>, produced either singly, or in bead-like,
or moniliform, strings, and which either precede or
are associated with the true spores; <i>Spores</i>, sometimes
simple, but often complex; and <i>Sporidia</i>, or
secondary sporules, which are produced on the
germinating threads of the true spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various genera of these endophytes owe
their distinctions to the form, or mode of development
of their true spores. In one instance these
spores are united in pairs, or divided by a septum,
so that they are two-celled: these are named <i>Puccinia</i>.
In another instance the spores are one-celled,
and at first borne upon a stalk or peduncle,
from which they are detached in ripening: such
are called <i>Trichobasis</i>. It is unnecessary here to
indicate all the variations to illustrate the fact that
the generic distinctions are based upon the characters
of the true spores. How unsatisfactory
such a mode will appear, when subjected to experience
day by day, a botanist would suspect. In
the same pustule, resting upon the same cushion of
mycelium, the spores of an <i>Aregma</i> will be found
with those of a <i>Lecythea</i>, and those of a <i>Puccinia</i>
with <i>Trichobasis</i>. More than this has even been
affirmed. The alternation of generations, known
to students in the animal world, is here repeated in
the vegetable. Dr. de Bary declares that certain
data appear to indicate that <i>Æcidium</i> constitutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>not a genus by itself, but are organs in the development
of some other germs and species, possessing
its spermogonia, its <i>Æcidium</i>; its <i>Uredo</i>, and its
spores, properly speaking; whilst in others the
<i>Uredo</i>-form the <i>Puccinia</i>-form, and the <i>Æcidium</i>-form
may alternate. It is not our intention to
enter deeply upon the discussion of this subject, of
so little interest to the beginner, and so out of
place in an introduction to the study. That forms
and conditions are multifarious, and that an entire
revision of the classification is inevitable, are facts
which do not require many words to establish.
Already it is to be feared that in this brief chapter
we have said too much, and must recommend its
perusal again, when the names and characters of
the genera alluded to have been rendered more
familiar.</p>

<p class='c008'>It could scarcely have been permitted that the
student should go far without being cautioned that
there is such a thing as di-morphism in microscopic
fungi; and the explanation of such a phenomenon
must presuppose a certain amount of knowledge
which, thus far, the reader could not have acquired.
Hence an anomaly, to escape from which an ultimate
return to the subject will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a recent account of Dr. de Bary’s experiments,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
an interesting history is given of the
development of a rust-like fungus, which is common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>on many plants of the pea and bean tribe. As it
may serve to illustrate some of the preceding, as
well as subsequent, remarks on development, an
abstract shall close this chapter.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>De Bary—“Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” ser. 4, vol. xx.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The spores of this species (<i>Uromyces appendiculatus</i>)
are oboval cells, terminated by a rounded
point, provided with a deep brown, smooth, <i>epispore</i>,
or outer coating, and a distinct, but colourless
<i>endospore</i>, or inner coating. These enclose a
granular matter, which surrounds what has been
termed the nucleus, but which appears to be a
vacuole. At the top of the epispore is a pore
which is characteristic of the genus. The spores
are supported on a colourless, or slightly-tinted
pedicel of considerable length (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 150).
By means of this pedicel, the spores are attached to
the fostering plant, on which they form pustules
or sori of a blackish colour, and variable extent.
These spores are ripened towards the end of
summer or beginning of autumn. During winter
they remain in a state of repose, but in the following
spring the faculty of germination developes
itself. At this period, when moistened or placed
on a humid soil, they germinate at the end of a
few days. The spore then emits a curved and
obtuse tube, which soon ceasing to elongate itself,
gives origin to three or four sporidia, of a reniform
or kidney shape. When cultivated on moistened
glass, these sporidia also emit a short, thin,
slender tube, which produce in turn secondary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>sporidia. Here vegetation ends in the artificial
culture above indicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the sporidia are sown upon the epidermis
of a favourable plant, the germ-tube being emitted,
penetrates the wall of any approximate cellule,
swells and increases into a cylindrical tube equal in
thickness to the original sporidia, and therefore
four or five times the diameter of the germ-tube
before it entered the cellule. The contents of the
sporidia and external portion of its germ-tube pass
into the portion within the cellule, and then these
external portions perish, and all evidence of the
entry is obliterated, except a very minute point at
which the tube remains attached to the inner surface
of the wall of the cellule. The enclosed tube
soon elongates, divides, and becomes branched.
These branches perforate the inner walls of the
epidermis, and pass into the intercellular spaces of
the parenchyma to become mycelium. This takes
place within 24 hours. A few days afterwards
the mycelium is spread through the parenchyma.
At length the surface of the same spots which had
been sown in the first instance with the sporidia,
become of a whitish tint, rapidly increasing and
intensifying. Three days after, little protuberances
appear on the surface of the white spots. These
are of an orange colour, and many of them are
surmounted by a little drop of mucilaginous fluid.
These are <i>spermogones</i>. Their number daily increases,
and a little time after appear numerous large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>globular protuberances intermingled with them.
These soon rupture the epidermis, and take the
orange colour and cylindrical form of cluster-cups
(<i>Æcidium</i>). At length the summit of the peridia
opens to allow the escape of the <i>stylospores</i>. It is
easy to assure oneself that the spermogones and
cluster-cups proceed from the mycelium of the
sporidia which had been sown. During several
days the length and number of the peridia of the
<i>Æcidium</i> continue to increase. One month after
sowing, brownish or blackish points make their
appearance upon the whitish spots, around, or
intermingled with the cluster-cups. These increase
rapidly in number and magnitude. Examined by
the microscope, they present the ordinary fructification
of <i>Uromyces</i>, mingled with stylospores.
Thus the mycelium of the cluster-cups engenders
at the end of its vegetation fruits equal in all points
to those from whence they are in the first instance
derived.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stylospores of the cluster-cups possess the
irregular, globular form and structure of their
congeners. They are filled with orange granular
matter, and provided with a colourless, finely-punctated
epispore. When these stylospores are
sown on the moistened epidermis of a favourable
plant, the germ-tube at first creeps along the
surface, but as soon as its extremities find a stomate,
it enters it and elongates itself in the air-cavity
below the orifice, receives the contents of the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>stylospore and exposed portion of its tube, then
separates itself from those parts, which become
dispersed. The active part increases and ramifies,
and produces a mycelium which spreads through
the intercellular passages of the parenchyma. At
the end of from six to eight days, the whitish spots
appear on the surface of the fostering plant, and
indicate that the fructification of the parasite is
about to commence. The epidermis is elevated
and broken, and little brown pustules appear
through the openings. These are the <i>stylospores</i>
of <i>Uredo</i>, which are produced in immense quantities,
and soon cover the pustules with a deep
brown dust. Later, the formation of the stylospores
is arrested, and the true germinating spores
appear in the same pustules.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stylospores of <i>Uredo</i> are borne singly at the
top of short filaments. On arriving at maturity
they detach themselves. They are of a globular
form, with a reddish-brown epispore, provided with
little pointed prominences, and three pores at equal
distances. After maturity they germinate in precisely
the same manner as the stylospores of the
cluster-cups. They enter only through the stomata
of the epidermis. The pulvinules are identical with
those which the stylospores of <i>Æcidium</i> originate,
and they also produce true spores at the end of
their vegetation. No other fruit arises from them.
These organs, therefore, always reproduce the same
form to which they owe their origin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The result of these investigations shows that the
bean rust (<i>Uromyces appendiculatus</i>), besides spermogones,
possesses four sorts of reproductive organs,
which all serve to propagate the species, but
that one alone of them produces it in a form always
identical, whilst the others present well-marked
alternations of generation. Hence it is concluded
that there are,</p>

<p class='c008'>I. <i>Spores</i> which produce in germinating the promycelium,
and</p>

<p class='c008'>II. <i>Sporidia.</i>—These give place to a mycelium,
which bears afterwards—</p>

<p class='c008'>III. <i>Æcidium.</i>—Particular organs which engender
stylospores, and which produce—</p>

<p class='c008'>IV. <i>Uredo</i>, the second form of the stylospores,
and later spores (No. I.), which are always associated
with <i>Uredo</i> in the same pustule. The spores
and stylospores of <i>Uredo</i> come also upon the old
mycelium, which has previously produced <i>Æcidium</i>.
The <i>Uredo</i> stylospores always produce <i>Uredo</i>, and
true spores.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>DR. WITHERING’S “Arrangement of British
Plants” in 1818 reached its sixth edition. This
is less than half a century ago, and yet the whole
number of species of Fungi described in that edition
was only 564, of which three hundred were included
under the old genus <i>Agaricus</i>. Less than eighty of
the more minute species of Fungi, but few of which
deserve the name of microscopic, were supposed to
contain all then known of these wonderful organisms.
Since that period, microscopes have become
very different instruments, and one result has
been the increase of Withering’s 564 species of
British Fungi to the 2,479 enumerated in the
“Index Fungorum Britannicorum.” By far the
greater number of species thus added depend for
their specific, and often generic characters, upon
microscopical examination. The proportion which
the cryptogamic section bears to the phanerogamic
in our local Floras before 1818, now almost involuntarily
causes a smile. Even such authors as were
supposed to pay the greatest possible respect to the
lower orders of plants could never present an equal
number of pages devoted to them, as to the higher
orders. Relhan, for instance, only occupies one-fifth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>of his “Flora Cantabrigiensis,” and Hudson
one-fourth of his “Flora Anglica,” with the Cryptogamia.
At the present time, it will be seen that,
with a liberal allowance for “hair-splitting,” the
number of British species of flowering plants
scarcely exceeds three-fourths of the number of
Fungi alone, not to mention ferns, mosses, algæ
and lichens, and yet we have no “Flora” which
contains them, and but a minority of our botanists
know anything about them. If we need excuse for
directing attention to some of the most interesting
of these plants, let the above remarks suffice in lieu
of formal apology.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mildew” is just one of those loose terms which
represent no definite idea, or a very different one
to different individuals. Talk of <i>mildew</i> to a
farmer, and instantly he scampers mentally over
his fields of standing corn in search of the brown
lines or irregular spots which indicate the unwelcome
presence of <i>Puccinia graminis</i>, known to him,
and to generations of farmers before him, as “mildew.”
Try to convince a Norfolk farmer that anything
else is “mildew,” and he will consider you
insane for your pains. Speak of <i>mildew</i> in your
own domestic circle, and inquire of wives, or
daughters, or servants, what it means, and without
hesitation another, and even more minute species
of fungus, which attacks damp linen, will be indicated
as the true mildew, to the exclusion of all
others; and with equal claims to antiquity. Go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Farnham, or any other hop-growing district, and
repeat there your question,—What is <i>mildew</i>?—and
there is every probability that you will be told
that it is a kind of mould which attacks the hop
plant, but which differs as much from both the
mildew of the farmer and the laundry-maid as they
differ from each other. The vine-grower has his
mildew, the gardener his mildewed onions, the
stationer his mildewed paper from damp cellars,
the plasterer his mildewed walls, and in almost
every calling, or sphere in life, wherever a minute
fungus commits its ravages upon stock, crop, or
chattels, to that individual owner it becomes a bug-bear
under the name of “mildew.” Reluctantly
this vague term has been employed as a portion
of the title to this chapter, but it must be limited
in its application to the “mildew of corn,” known
to botanists as <i>Puccinia graminis</i>, and <i>not</i> to include
the numerous other microscopic Fungi to which the
name of <i>mildew</i> is often applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>The origin of this term and its true application
may undoubtedly be traced to <i>mehl-thau</i>, “meal
dew.” A singular proof of the ignorance which
prevails in regard to all the fungal diseases of corn,
may be found in the fact that at least one of our
best etymological dictionaries states that the <i>mildew</i>
in corn is the same as the <i>ergot</i> of the French.
Had the writer ever been a farmer, he would have
known the difference; had he ever seen the two,
he could scarcely have made such a mistake. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>is barely possible for him ever to have heard the
ergot of grain called by the name of <i>mildew</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>How long this disease has been known, is an
unsolved problem. About the middle of the last
century a tract was published on this subject in
Italy, but this was probably not even the first intimation
of its fungoid character. Before such conclusion
had been arrived at, men may have struggled
in the dark, through many generations, to account
for a phenomenon with which they were doubtless
familiar in its effects. In 1805, Sir Joseph Banks
published his “Short Account,” illustrated by engravings
from the inimitable drawings of Bauer,
whereby many in this country learnt, for the first
time, the true nature of <i>mildew</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'>With a view to the clearer understanding of these
parasites in the phases of their development, let us
select one, and we cannot do better than adhere to
that of the wheat and other graminaceous plants.
A fine day in May or June dawns upon our preparations
for a stroll, far enough into the country to find
a wheat-field. Even now, with the area of the
metropolis constantly widening, and banishing
farmers and wheat fields farther and farther from
the sound of Bow-bells, a corn field may be reached
by a good stiff walk from Charing-Cross, or a six-penny
ride at the most, in nearly any direction.
Having reached the field, it may be premised that a
walk into it of less than twenty yards will be sure
to reward you with the fungus we are in quest of.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Look down at the green leaves, especially the lower
ones, and you will soon find one apparently grown
rusty. The surface seems to be sprinkled with
powdered red ochre, and grown sickly under the
operation. Pluck it carefully, and examine it with
a pocket lens. Already the structure of a healthy
leaf is familiar to you, but in the present instance
the cuticle is traversed with numerous longitudinal
cracks or fissures, within which, and about their
margins, you discern an orange powder, to which
the rusty appearance of the leaf is due. Further
examination reveals also portions in which the
cuticle is distended into yellowish elongated
pustules, not yet ruptured, and which is an earlier
stage of the same disease. This is the “rust” of
the agriculturist, the <i>Trichobasis rubigo-vera</i> of
botanists, the first phase of the corn mildew.</p>

<p class='c008'>To know more of this parasite, we must have
recourse to the microscope; having therefore collected
a few leaves for this purpose, we return
homewards to follow up the investigation. We
will not stay to detail the processes of manipulation,
since these will not offer any deviation from
the ordinary modes of preparation and examination
of delicate vegetable tissues.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vegetative system of the “rust,” and similar
fungi, consists of a number of delicate, simple, or
branched threads, often intertwining and anastomosing,
or uniting one to the other by means of
lateral branchlets. These threads, termed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>mycelium, penetrate the intercellular spaces, and
insinuate themselves in a complete network, amongst
the cells of which the leaf, or other diseased portion
of the plant, is composed. High powers of the
microscope, and equally high powers of patience
and perseverance, are necessary to make out this
part of the structure. We may regard the whole
mycelium of one pustule, or spore-spot, as the
vegetative system of one fungal plant. At first
this mycelium might have originated in a number
of individuals, which afterwards became confluent
and combined into one for the production of fruit,
that is to say, an indefinite number of points in the
vicinity of the future mycelium developed threads;
and these, in the process of growth, interlaced each
other, and ultimately, by means of transverse processes,
became united into one vegetative system,
in which the individuality of each of the elementary
threads became absorbed, and by one combined
effort a spore-spot, or cluster of fruit, was produced.
In the first instance a number of minute, transparent,
colourless cellules are developed from the
mycelium: these enlarge, become filled with an
orange-coloured endochrome, and appear beneath
the cuticle of the leaf as yellowish spots. As a
consequence of this increase in bulk, the cuticle
becomes distended in the form of a pustule over the
yellow cellules, and at length, unable longer to
withstand the pressure from beneath, ruptures in
irregular, more or less elongated fissures (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>fig. 141), and the yellow bodies, now termed <i>spores</i>
(whether correctly so, we do not at present inquire),
break from their short pedicels and escape, to the
naked eye presenting the appearance of an orange
or rust-coloured powder. In this stage the spores
are globose, or nearly so, and consist of but one
cell <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> figs. 142, 144). It will afford much
instructive amusement to examine one of these
ruptured pustules as an opaque object under a low
power, and afterwards the spores may be viewed
with a higher power as a transparent object. The
difference in depth of tint, the nearly colourless and
smaller immature spores, and the tendency in some
of the fully matured ones to elongate, are all facts
worthy of notice, as will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'>A month or two later in the season, and we will
make another trip to the cornfield. Rusty leaves,
and leaf-sheaths, have become even more common
than before. A little careful examination, and, here
and there, we shall find a leaf or two with decidedly
brown pustules intermixed with the rusty ones, or,
as we have observed several times during the past
autumn, the pustules towards the base of the leaf
orange, and those towards the apex reddish-brown.
If we remove from the browner spots a little of the
powder, by means of a sharp-pointed knife, and
place it in a drop of water or alcohol on a glass
slide, and after covering with a square of thin glass,
submit it to examination under a quarter-inch
objective, a different series of forms will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>observed. There will still be a proportion of subglobose,
one-celled, yellow spores; but the majority
will be elongated, most with pedicels or stalks, if
they have been carefully removed from the leaf, and
either decidedly two-celled, or with an evident
tendency to become so. The two cells are separated
by a partition or dissepiment, which divides the
original cell transversely into an upper and lower
cell, with an external constriction in the plane of
the dissepiment (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 59). These bilocular
or two-celled spores are those of the “corn mildew”
(<i>Puccinia graminis</i>), which may be produced in the
same pustules, and from the same mycelium, as the
“corn rust,” but which some mycologists consider
to be a distinct fungus, others only a modification or
stage of the same fungus. After an examination of
the different forms in the allied genera to which
these chapters are devoted, we shall be able with
less of explanation and circumlocution to canvass
these two conflicting opinions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us proceed, for the third and last time, to
our cornfield, when the corn is nearly or fully ripe,
or let us look over any bundle of straw, and we
shall find blackish spots, from the size of a pin’s
head to an inch in length, mostly on the sheaths of
the leaves, often on the culm itself. This is the
fully developed <i>mildew</i>, and when once seen is not
likely afterwards to be confounded with any other
parasite on straw (fig. 57). The drawings of Bauer
have already been alluded to. Bauer was botanical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>draughtsman to George III., and his exquisite
drawings, both of the germination of wheat and
the fungi which infest it, are marvels of artistic
skill. A reduced figure from part of one of his
drawings is given (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 58), exhibiting
a tuft of the bilocular spores of <i>Puccinia graminis</i>
bursting through a piece of wheat straw. These
closely-packed tufts or masses of spores, when
examined with a common lens, seem, at first, to
resemble the minute sorus of some species of fern;
but when seen with higher powers, the apparent
resemblance gives place to something very different.
The tufts consist of multitudes of stalked
bodies, termed spores, which are constricted in the
middle and narrowed towards either extremity.
The partition, or septum, thrown across the spore
at the constriction, separates it into two portions,
each of which consists of a cell-wall enclosing an
inner vesicle filled with the endochrome (fig. 59) or
granular contents, in which a nucleus may often be
made out. This species of <i>Puccinia</i> is very common
on all the cereals cultivated in this country,
and on many of the grasses. A variety found on
the reed was at one time considered a distinct
species; but the difference does not seem sufficient
to warrant a separation. However near some other of
the recognized species may seem to approximate in
the form of the spores, a very embryo botanist will
not fail to observe the distinctive features in the
spores of the corn mildew, and speedily recognize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>them amongst a host of others; subject, as they
may be, to slight deviations in form, resulting
either from external pressure, checks in development,
or other accidental circumstances, or the
variations of age.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no doubt in the minds of agriculturists,
botanists, <i>savans</i>, or farm-labourers, that the mildew
is very injurious to the corn crop. Different
opinions may exist as to how the plants become
inoculated, or how infection may be prevented or
cured. Some have professed to believe that the
spores, such as we have seen produced in clusters
on wheat straw, enter by the stomata, or pores, of
the growing plant, “and at the bottom of the hollows
to which they lead they germinate and push
their minute roots into the cellular texture.” Such
an explanation, however plausible at first sight,
fails on examination, from the fact that the spores
are too large to find ingress by such minute openings.
It is improbable that the <i>spores</i> enter the
growing plant at all. The granular contents of
the spores may effect an entrance either through
the roots or by the stomata, or the globose bodies
produced upon the germination of the spores may
be the primary cause of infection. We are not
aware that this question has been satisfactorily
determined. It is worthy of remembrance by all
persons interested in the growth of corn, that the
mildew is most common upon plants growing on
the site of an old dunghill, or on very rich soil.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>As the same <i>Puccinia</i> is also to be found on
numerous grasses, no prudent farmer will permit
these to luxuriate around the borders of his fields,
lest they should serve to introduce or increase the
pest he so much dreads.</p>

<p class='c008'>The germination of the spores of the corn mildew
is a very interesting and instructive process,
which may be observed with a very little trouble.
If the spores be scraped from the sori of the preceding
year (we are not sure that those of the
current year will succeed), and kept for a short time
in a damp atmosphere under a glass receiver,
minute colourless threads will be seen to issue both
from the upper and lower divisions of the spores.
These will attain a length several times that of the
spores from whence they spring. The extremities
of these threads ultimately thicken, and two or
three septæ are formed across each, dividing it
into cells, in which a little orange-coloured endochrome
accumulates. From the walls of each of
these cells, or joints, a small pedicel, or spicule, is
produced outwards, the tip of which gradually
swells until a spherical head is formed, into which
the orange-coloured fluid passes from the extremities
of the threads.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> A quantity of such threads,
bearing at their summits from one to four of these
orange-coloured, spherical, secondary fruits, supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>a beautiful as well as interesting object for the
microscope. When matured, these globose bodies,
which Tulasne has called <i>sporidia</i>, fall from the
threads, and commence germinating on their own
account. It is not impossible that the sporidia, in
this and allied genera, may themselves produce a
third and still more minute fruit, capable of diffusion
through the tissues of growing plants, or
gaining admission by their stomata. Nothing of
the kind, however, has yet been of certainty discovered.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Forty other species of <i>Puccinia</i> have been
recorded as occurring in Great Britain, to all of
which many of the foregoing remarks will also
apply—viz., such as relate to their two-celled spores
being found associated with, and springing from,
the same mycelium as certain orange-coloured one-celled
spores; and also the main features of the
germinating process.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c023'>A very singular and interesting species is not
uncommon on the more delicate grasses, being
found chiefly confined to the leaves, and produced
in smaller and more rounded, or but slightly elongated,
patches (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 60). We have met with
it plentifully amongst the turf laid down in the
grounds of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, and
also on hedge-banks and in pastures. The spores
are rather smaller than those of <i>Puccinia graminis</i>,
but, like them, much elongated, slightly constricted,
and borne on persistent peduncles. The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>prominent distinction may be found in the apices of
the spores, which, in this instance, are not attenuated,
but crowned with a series of little spicules,
or teeth, whence the specific name of <i>coronata</i> has
been derived (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 62).</p>

<p class='c008'>The Labiate family of plants and its ally the
Scrophulariaceæ are also subject to the attacks of
several kinds of Brand, a name, by the bye, often
applied locally to the corn mildew and other similar
parasites, and which may have originated in the
scorched or <i>burnt</i> appearance which the infected
parts generally assume. In the former natural
order the different kinds of mint, the ground-ivy,
the wood-sage, and the betony, and in the latter,
the water figwort and several species of veronica,
or speedwell, are peculiarly susceptible; and on
most a distinct species of <i>Puccinia</i> is found. To
provide against doubt which the less botanical of
our readers may possess of the meaning or value of
the term <i>Puccinia</i>, which has already occurred two
or three times in this chapter, a brief explanation
may be necessary, which more scientific readers
will excuse.</p>

<p class='c008'>In botany, as in kindred sciences, acknowledged
species have their trivial, or specific name, generally
derived from the Latin. In the last species referred
to, this was <i>coronata</i>, meaning <i>crowned</i>, in reference
to the coronated apex of the fruit. Any indefinite
number of species with some features in common
are associated together in a group, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>termed a <i>genus</i>, and the term prefixed to the specific
name of each species constituting that genus is its
generic name, also commonly derived from the
Latin or Greek. In this instance it is <i>Puccinia</i>,
derived from the Greek <i>puka</i>, meaning <i>closely
packed</i>, singularly applicable to the manner in
which the spores are packed together in the pustules.
The common features, or generic distinctions,
of this genus, are uniseptate spores borne on
a distinct peduncle.</p>

<p class='c008'>In returning to the species found on Labiate
plants, let us suppose ourselves to have strolled
towards Hampstead Heath, and south of the road
leading from Hampstead to Highgate, near certain
conspicuous and well-known arches, built for a purpose
not yet attained, are two or three muddy
ponds nearly choked up with vegetation. Some
fine autumnal afternoon, we must imagine ourselves
to have reached the margin of the most northern of
these ponds, and amidst a thick growth of reeds,
sedges, and other water-loving plants, to have
found the water-mint in profusion and luxuriance,
with every leaf more or less occupied, on its under
surface, with the yellow spores of a species of rust
(<i>Trichobasis</i>) mixed with the browner septate spores
of the mint brand (<i>Puccinia Menthæ</i>). This is common
also on the horse-mint and corn-mint; we
have found it on the wild basil and wild thyme,
and once only on marjoram. Having collected as
many leaves as we desire, and returned to home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and the microscope, we proceed to examine them
in the same manner as we have already examined
the mildew, and as a result of such proceeding
arrive at the following conclusions:—The pustules
are small and round, never elongated as in the corn
mildew, and generally confined to the under surface
of the leaves (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 69). The spores are subglobose,
slightly constricted, and the two cells nearly
two hemispheres, with their flat surfaces turned towards
each other (fig. 70). The form delineated in
figure 75 is that of the sorus of many of the epiphytal
brands, the centre being occupied by the
closely-packed spores, surrounded to a greater or
less extent by the remains of the ruptured
epidermis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the species of Puccinia (<i>P. glechomatis</i>)
found on the leaves of the ground-ivy is said to be
very common, we sought it in vain amongst every
cluster of that plant met with during last summer
and autumn, until, nearly despairing of finding it
at all, we at last encountered a plot of ground-ivy
covering the ground to the width of two or three
yards, and in length eight or ten, nearly every plant
being attacked by the <i>brand</i>. This was in the
corner of a pasture, and the only time we found
infected plants. The fungus, however, may be as
common as the plant in other localities. The pustules
on the leaves are larger than those of the
mints, and also confined to the inferior surface
(fig. 73). The spores are elliptic and but slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>constricted; the apex is often pointed, though not
always so much as in our figure (fig. 74).</p>

<p class='c008'>Of other species found on allied plants we have
not considered it necessary to give figures, or write
much. The betony brand (<i>P. Betonicæ</i>, DC.) does
not seem to be common enough to be readily found
by any one desiring to examine it for himself;
and the same may be said of the figwort brand
(<i>P. Scrophulariæ</i>, Lib.), the wood-sage brand
(<i>P. Scorodoniæ</i>, Lk.), and the speedwell brand
(<i>P. Veronicarum</i>, DC.); all of these are, however,
characterized by a distinct feature, or features, which
have been considered of sufficient importance to
constitute a separate species.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have had occasion to refer incidentally to the
brand found on the under surface of the leaves of
the wood-anemone (<i>P. Anemones</i>, P.). This is one
of the earliest and commonest species. Go wherever
the wood-anemone abounds, in any of the woods
lying immediately to the north of the metropolis,
or any of the woods in Kent, and from March
to May it will not be difficult to find attenuated,
sickly-looking leaves, with the under surface covered
with the pustules of this brand, looking so like the
sori of some fern (fig. 65) that it <i>has</i> been, and
still <i>is</i>, sometimes considered as such. In Ray’s
“Synopsis” (3rd edition, 1724), it is described in
company with the maidenhair and wall-rue ferns; a
figure is given of it in the same work (t. iii. fig. 1),
and it is stated,—“this capillary was gathered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the Conjuror of Chalgrave.” When, afterwards,
it was better understood, and the spots came to be
regarded as true parasitic fungi, it still for a long
time continued to bear the name, not even yet
quite forgotten, of the Conjuror of Chalgrave’s fern.</p>

<p class='c008'>An examination of the spores, both collectively
in the pustules, and separately under a high power,
will not fail to convince any one who has examined
only the species we have already alluded to,
that this parasite on the anemone (<i>P. Anemones</i>) is
a true <i>Puccinia</i>, and a most interesting one. The
two cells of the spores are nearly spherical, and the
constriction is deeper and more positive than in
any of the preceding. Moreover, the surface of the
spore is minutely and beautifully echinulate, or covered
with erect spines (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 66). Some few
other of the species found in Britain have echinulate
spores, but those are not common like the present.
One word of caution to the amateur in search of
the <i>Puccinia</i> on the anemone. It will be fruitless
looking for it on the large foliaceous bracts of the
flower-stalk, since these may be turned up carefully,
till the back aches with stooping, ere a solitary
pustule will be found; but the true leaves,
proceeding from the rhizomes, are certain soon to
afford you specimens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everybody knows the dandelion, but it is not
every one who has noticed the fungi found upon its
leaves. These are most commonly of two kinds,
or probably the unilocular and bilocular forms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the same species: the latter we have found in the
month of May, and the former in August and
September. The lower leaves of young seedlings
have generally rewarded us with the best
specimens of the septate-fruited brand (<i>Puccinia
variabilis</i>, Grev.). The pustules occur on both
sides of the leaf, and are very small and scattered
(fig. 82). The spores are singularly variable in
form: sometimes both divisions are nearly equal
in size; sometimes the upper, and sometimes the
lower, division is the smallest; occasionally the
septum will be absent altogether; and more rarely,
the spores will contain three cells. From the very
variable character of the spores (fig. 83), the
specific name has been derived.</p>

<p class='c008'>No species in the entire genus makes so prominent
an appearance as the one found on the radical
leaves of the spear thistle (<i>Carduus lanceolatus</i>).
This latter plant is exceedingly abundant, and so
is its parasite (<i>Puccinia syngenesiarum</i>, Lk.). From
the month of July till the frosts set in we may be
almost certain of finding specimens in any wood.
The leaves have a paler roundish spot, from one-twelfth
to one-fourth of an inch in diameter, on the
upper surface, and a corresponding dark brown
raised spot on the under surface, caused by an
aggregation of pustules, forming a large compound
pustule, often partly covered with the epidermis.
The individual pustules are small, but this aggregate
mode of growth gives the clusters great prominence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>and therefore they are not easily overlooked
(<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 63). Although not confined to
this species of thistle, we have not yet found this
<i>Puccinia</i> on any other plant. The spores are elliptical,
rather elongated, constricted, and without
spines (fig. 64).</p>

<p class='c008'>Other species of <i>Puccinia</i> are found on Composite
plants, but with none of these is the present fungus
likely to be confounded, if regard be had to its
peculiar habit. The leaves, for instance, of the
common knapweed (<i>Centaurea nigra</i>) are often
sprinkled with the small pustules of the centaury
brand (<i>Puccinia compositarum</i>, Sch.); these generally
occupy the under surface of the lower radical
leaves (fig. 67); occasionally a few of the pustules
appear on the upper surface. We have not often
found this fungus in the neighbourhood of London
on the leaves of the knapweed, but, on the other
hand, we have encountered it very commonly on
those of the saw-wort (<i>Serratula tinctoria</i>). The
spores are oval, scarcely constricted, and not attenuated
in either direction (fig. 68). Other Composite
plants than those above named are liable to
attacks from this parasite.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our school-days we remember to have spent
many a stray half-hour digging for “earthnuts,”
under which name we, as well as our elders and
betters, knew the tubers of <i>Bunium flexuosum</i>.
Not then, nor for many years after, did we notice,
or regard if we did notice, the distorted radical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>leaves and leaf-stalks, and the blackish-brown spots,
which reveal the cause in the presence of a brand,
or parasitic fungus, of this genus (<i>Puccinia Umbelliferarum</i>,
DC.), which is extremely common on this,
as well as some other allied plants. If any spot is
searched where this plant grows in any profusion,
before the flowering stalks have made their appearance
above the surrounding grass, this <i>Puccinia</i>
will be readily found by the twisted, contorted,
sickly appearance of the infested leaves (fig. 71),
the petioles of which are often swollen and gouty in
consequence. The sporidia are shortly stalked, and
generally very much constricted (fig. 72). The
species found on the stems of the hemlock, and also
that on Alexanders (<i>Smyrnium Olusatrum</i>), are distinct;
the spores of the latter being covered with
tubercles or warts (figs. 55, 56). During a botanical
ramble through Darenth Wood in April of the year
just passed away, in some parts of which the
sanicle abounds, we found the bright glossy leaves
of this singular and interesting plant freely sprinkled
with the pustules of a <i>Puccinia</i> (<i>P. Saniculæ</i>, Grev.),
which is not at all uncommon on this, but has not
hitherto been found on any other plant. Dr. Greville,
of Edinburgh, was the first to describe this,
as well as many other of our indigenous minute
Fungi. For many years he has toiled earnestly
and vigorously at the lower cryptogams, as evidenced
by his “Scottish Cryptogamic Flora,”
published in 1823; and yet his continual additions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to the records of science show him to be earnest
and vigorous still.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have by no means exhausted the catalogue
of Fungi belonging to this genus found in Britain,
nor even those commonly to be met with; but the
fear of prolixity, and the desire to introduce a
description of other forms into the space still remaining
to us, prompt us to dismiss these two-celled
brands with but a brief allusion to such as we cannot
describe. Box-leaves are the habitat of one species,
and those of the periwinkle (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> fig. 132) of
another. One vegetates freely on the leaves of violets
through the months of July and August, and another
less frequently on the enchanter’s nightshade. Several
species of willow-herb (<i>Epilobium</i>) are attacked
by one <i>Puccinia</i> (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> figs. 78, 79), and a single
species by another. Plum-tree leaves, bean-leaves,
primrose leaves, and the half-dead stems of asparagus,
have their separate and distinct species, and
others less commonly attack the woodruff, bedstraw
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> figs. 172, 173), knotgrass, ragwort, and
other plants less common, more local, or, to the generality
of the non-botanical, but imperfectly known.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have found, not uncommonly in the autumn,
the scattered pustules of a brand on the stems and
leaves of the goat’s-beard, occupying the places
which were scarred with the remains of cluster-cups
that had flourished on the same spots a month or two
previously (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig. 76). The pustules are by
no means minute, but elongated and bullate; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>spores beautifully studded with warts (<a href='#i056'>Plate IV.</a> fig.
77). This species cannot certainly be identical with
<i>Puccinia compositarum</i> (Schlecht), <i>P. syngenesiarum</i>
(Lk.), or <i>P. tragopogonis</i> (Corda). In none of these
do the spores appear to be warted, and the habits
of both the latter are different. Its nearest associate
appears to be <i>P. centauriæ</i> (Corda), at least in the
fruit, and whilst the form and character of these
organs are considered of any value in the determination
of species, smooth spores cannot be associated,
we think, with tuberculate or echinulate spores under
the same name.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the spores of the species to which attention
has been more specially directed we have types of
the principal forms. In the “corn-mildew” they
are elongated, and tapering towards either end; in
the “coronated brand” the apex is crowned with
spicular processes; in the “wind-flower brand” the
entire spores are echinulate; in the “mint brand”
they are globose; in the “composite brand” elliptic;
in the “earth-nut brand,” nearly cut in two at the
septum; and in the “dandelion brand,” so variable
in form that no two are precisely alike. On the
other hand, all are characterized by a transverse
septum dividing each spore into two cells.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>FROM the twin-spored genus we pass to another,
in which the spores are usually divided into three
cells, and which, from this cause, has been named
<i>Triphragmium</i>. Only one species has hitherto been
found in this country, and <i>that</i> not very commonly,
on the leaves of the meadow-sweet, <i>Spiræa ulmaria</i>
(<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 47). Externally, it much resembles,
in the size and character of the pustules, many of
the above-named brands, but when seen under the
microscope this similarity disappears. In general
outline the spores are nearly globose, and externally
papillose. In one species, found on the Continent,
but not hitherto in Great Britain, the spores are
covered with curious long-hooked spines, by means
of which they adhere tenaciously to each other. In
germination, the spores of <i>Triphragmium</i> do not
offer any noteworthy deviation from those of <i>Puccinia</i>,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
and the chief interest of our indigenous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>species lies in the three-celled form of its spores
(fig. 48), to which occasionally those of <i>Puccinia
variabilis</i> approximate, and may be regarded as the
link which unites the two genera.</p>

reduced from the figure by Tulasne.—(<i>Vide</i> Currey, in “Quarterly
Journal of Microscopical Science,” 1857, pp. 117, &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c008'>The old story of “Eyes and no Eyes” is too often
literally true, not only with the children it was
written to amuse and instruct, but also with children
of a larger growth who scorn such baby tales,
and disdain such baby morals. Out of more than a
thousand indigenous species of microscopic fungi,
of which there is generally some evidence afforded
of their presence visible to the naked eye, how few
are there of the millions that inhabit our island who
can count twenty species that they have ever seen;
still fewer that have noticed one hundred. Amongst
the twenty species known to the few will probably
be included one which appears in autumn in prominent
black spots, the size of a large pin’s head, or
half a turnip seed, with the flat face downwards,
sprinkling the under surface of blackberry leaves
(fig. 39); with larger, reddish, purplish, or reddish-brown
spots on the upper to indicate the presence
of the fungus beneath. Just at the time when
blackberries are ripe, these spots are in perfection
on the leaves, and <i>their</i> eyes must have been sadly
at fault who could ever have gathered their own
blackberries without seeing the discoloured leaves.
The coloured spots on the face of the leaf are due
to the diseased state of the tissues caused by the
parasite on the opposite surface. As much of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>leaf as contains two or three of the black pustules
should be removed carefully with a knife or sharp
scissors, and submitted to microscopical examination;
each will be seen to consist of a dense tuft of
blackish, elongated, stalked bodies, clustered as in
fig. 44, but much more numerously and closely
packed together. These are the spores of the blackberry
brand (<i>Aregma bulbosum</i>, Fr.). A few of
these spores should be removed on the point of a
sharp penknife, placed on a glass slide with a drop
of distilled water or alcohol, covered with thin glass,
and then viewed with a quarter-inch objective.
Each spore has a stalk longer than itself, thickened
below, and containing a yellow granular core. The
spore itself is much longer than in any of the <i>Pucciniæ</i>,
of a dark brown colour, and apparently
divided by several transverse partitions into three,
four, or more cells, the whole surface being covered
with minute warts or prominences (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 41).</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1857, Mr. F. Currey investigated the structure
of these spores, and the results of these experiments
were detailed in the “Quarterly Journal of
Microscopical Science.” One conclusion arrived at
was, that “the idea of the fruit consisting of sporidia
united together and forming a chain, is
certainly not in accordance with the true structure.
The sporidia are not united to one another in any
way, but, although closely packed for want of space,
they are in fact free in the interior of what may be
called a sporangium or ascus.” To arrive at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>conclusion, careful examination was necessary, and
new modes of manipulation essential. The details
of one method employed were to the following
effect:—A sufficient number of spores were removed
on the point of a lancet, and placed on a slide in a
drop of alcohol. Before the spirit was quite evaporated,
two or three drops of strong nitric acid
were added, and the whole covered with thin glass.
The slide was then warmed over a spirit-lamp, the
acid not being allowed to boil, but only gradually
heated to boiling point. By this means the
fruit was found to consist of an outer membrane,
nearly transparent, and studded with tubercles;
that this membrane enclosed a number of cells
which constituted the apparent joints, and which
were naturally flattened at either end by mutual
pressure. When the outer membrane was dissolved
or ruptured, these cells escaped, and became detached
from each other. The cells, thus set free,
exhibited a brownish or yellow ring around a paler
area, in the interior of which an inner cell was
visible, sometimes globular, often irregular in shape.
The examination of the ring was not entirely satisfactory;
it appeared to be sometimes marked with
concentric lines having the appearance of wrinkles.
The inner cell had granular contents and a central
nucleus. When perfectly free they were spherical
in form, with a distinct membrane of their own;
and colourless, except when acted upon by reagents.
The means employed to determine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>existence of these cells was to soak the spores in
muriatic acid; then, upon pressure of the glass cover,
the outer membrane and ringed cells were ruptured,
and the inner cell escaped (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 46).</p>

<p class='c008'>Germination may be induced in these spores by
keeping them in a moist atmosphere (fig. 45); but
the mode does not differ from that described above
as occurring in the “corn mildew.” Mr. Currey
writes:—“I know no microscopical object of greater
beauty than a number of fruits of <i>Phragmidium</i> in
active germination.” By <i>Phragmidium</i> he means
the <i>Aregma</i> of this work, of which <i>Phragmidium</i> is
a synonyme.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well may the reader remark on arriving thus
far, “Does all this examination and detail refer to
the fruit borne in the little blackish spots on bramble
leaves, which I have hitherto overlooked?” Ay,
and to several similar spots on other plants. Examine
carefully the raspberry leaves in your garden,
and you will probably find similar, but smaller,
pustules also on the under surface (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 42).
We say <i>probably</i>, because none of our British species
seem to be equally uncommon with this. During
the past year we examined hundreds of plants, and
did not find a single pustule. This species was
named by Dr. Greville <i>Aregma gracilis</i>, which name
it still continues to bear (fig. 43). Such a fate will
not await you if you should proceed in the autumn
to some chalky district where the burnet is common.
Go, for instance, to Greenhithe or Northfleet, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>North Kent Railway, in August or September,
where the burnet is plentiful, and the leaves will
present the appearance of having been peppered
beneath, from the number of minute pustules of the
burnet brand scattered over the under surface
(fig. 30, upper leaflets). Or if you prefer collecting
nearer home, visit some neighbouring garden, if
your own does not contain many roses, and the
leaves will be found equally prolific in an allied
species (fig. 36). Should gardens and roses be
alike unattainable, any bank or wood will furnish
the barren strawberry (<i>Potentilla fragariastrum</i>),
and during the latter part of the summer, or
in autumn, another species of <i>Aregma</i> will not
be uncommon on the under surface of the leaves
(fig. 33). All these species will be found accompanied
by the orange spores of species of <i>Lecythea</i>,
which some mycologists consider to be distinct
fungi, and others to be merely forms or conditions
of <i>Aregma</i>. These spores are represented in <a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a>
figs. 31, 34, 37, and 40. From the magnified
figures of the spores of the different species of
<i>Aregma</i> (figs. 32, 35, 38, 41, and 43), it will be
apparent that they have all certain features in
common, <i>i.e.</i>, cylindrical spores containing from
three to seven cells. This may be called the <i>generic</i>
character, common to all the species of the genus
<i>Aregma</i>. Again, each species will be observed to
possess its own distinct features, which may be
termed its <i>specific</i> character. In one, the apex of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the spores will be obtuse, in another acutely pointed,
in another bluntly pointed, &amp;c. In one species the
number of cells will usually be four, in another five
or six, in another seven or eight. The stem in one
species will be slender and equal, in another thickened
or bulbous. So that in all there will be some
permanent peculiarity for each not shared by the
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>One other form of brand (<i>Xenodochus carbonarius</i>),
presenting, it is believed by some, generic differences
from all that we have as yet noticed, remains to be
briefly alluded to. This form appears to be very
uncommon in this country, but, when found, is
parasitic on the leaves of the great burnet (<i>Sanguisorba
officinalis</i>), a plant of local distribution. The
parasite appears to the naked eye in small tufts or
pustules resembling those of an <i>Aregma</i>, but, when
microscopically examined, the cells of the spores are
found to be numerous, indeed, considerably more
than in the most complex <i>Aregma</i> (fig. 29). This,
however, seems to be the only distinction, for the
cells are free in the interior of the investing membrane,
and in all points of structure, in so far as it
has been examined, identical with <i>Aregma</i>. Whether
it is logical to consider a four-celled spore an <i>Aregma</i>,
and a seven-celled spore an <i>Aregma</i>, and exclude a
ten or twelve-celled spore from the same genus on
account of the number of its cells, does not appear
to us clearly answerable in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the course of this and the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>chapter we have passed rapidly through four genera
of parasitic fungi so nearly allied, that one is almost
led to doubt the validity of the generic distinctions.
These may be presented briefly thus:—</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been seen that the habit, mode of growth,
germination, and structure, except in the number
of cells, scarcely differ; but it is not our province
here to enter upon the discussion of such a subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The association of one-celled, orange-coloured
spores with the brown two or more celled spores
passed in review is another feature worthy of
a passing notice, and which opens a field for discussion.
It is generally admitted that these two
forms are the production of the self-same mycelium
or vegetative system, but it is not so generally
admitted that they are but two forms or phases
of the fruit of the same plant. It is not at all
uncommon in the history of mycology to find two
forms which were for a long time considered to be
distinct plants producing different forms of fruit,
and which bore different names, and were located
in different genera, at length proved to be only the
self-same plant in different conditions, and ending
in one name being expunged from the list. Such
a fate probably awaits, at no distant date, the orange
spores which precede or accompany the species in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the present genera. Already Tulasne and some
others accord them no place in their system.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be added, for the benefit of any who wish
to pursue the study of this interesting branch of
Cryptogamic Botany, that the leaves of the plants
containing the parasitic fungi now noticed may be
collected and preserved by drying between folds of
blotting-paper, or the leaves of a book, and will
retain their character, with the exception of colour
in the orange forms, so as to be eligible for examination
at any period of the year for twenty years to
come. Each species, when dry, may be transferred
to an old envelope, and labelled outside with the
name, date of collection, and locality; and one
hundred such envelopes will constitute a miniature
herbarium in a very small compass.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>ONE of the fungal diseases of corn long and
widely known has obtained amongst agriculturists
different appellations in different localities.
In some it is the “smut,” in others it is
respectively “dust-brand,” “bunt-ear,” “black-ball,”
and “chimney-sweeper,” all referring, more
or less, to the blackish soot-like dust with which
the infected and abortive ears are covered. This
fungus does not generally excite so much concern
amongst farmers as the other affections to which
their corn-crops are liable. Perhaps it is not really
so extensively injurious, although it entirely destroys
every ear of corn upon which it establishes itself.
Wheat, barley, oats, rye, and many grasses are
subject to its attacks, and farmers have been heard
to declare that they like to see a little of it, because
its presence proves the general excellence of the
whole crop. No one who has passed through a field
of standing corn, after its greenness has passed
away, but before it is fully ripe, can have failed to
notice, here and there, a spare, lean-looking ear,
completely blackened with a coating of minute dust
(<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 98). If he has been guilty of brushing
in amongst the corn, it will still be remembered how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>his hands and clothing became dusted with this
powder; and if at the time he should have been clad
in sombre black, evidence will have been afforded—in
the rusty-looking tint of the powder when
sprinkled upon his black continuations—that, however
sooty this powder might appear whilst still
adhering to the ears of corn, it has an evident brown
tint when in contact with one’s clothes. This
powder, minute as it is, every granule of it constitutes
a spore or protospore capable of germination,
and ultimately, after several intermediate stages, of
reproducing a fungus like the parent of which it
formed a part. During the growth of the plant its
virulent contents flow like a poison through the
innermost tissues, and at length attack the peduncle
or axis of the spikelets of the ear, raising up the
essential organs and reducing them to a rudimentary
state. Brongniart, who made this species the
special subject of observation, states that the fleshy
mass which is occupied by the fungus consists
entirely of uniform tissue, presenting large, almost
quadrilateral cavities, separated by walls, composed
of one or two layers of very small cells filled with
a compact homogeneous mass of very minute granules,
perfectly spherical and equal, slightly adhering
to each other, and at first green, afterwards
free or simply conglomerate towards the centre of
each mass, and of a pale rufous hue; at length the
cellular walls disappear, the globules become completely
insulated, and the whole mass is changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>into a heap of powder, consisting of very regular
globules, perfectly alike, black, and just like the
reproductive bodies of other fungi (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 99).
A scientific botanist of some repute, M. Unger, published
a work in Vienna during the year 1823, in
which he sought to prove that this, and allied
species of fungi, were not fungi at all, but merely
broken up cells, or disruptured and altered conditions
of certain portions of the diseased plants.
The most satisfactory refutation of this theory may
be found in the fact that the spores of the smut can
be seen to germinate under favourable conditions,
and produce fruit, whereas, if they were only the
ordinary cells of the plant broken up by disease,
fructification would not take place.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spores in this species are exceedingly minute.
It has been ascertained that forty-nine of them
would be contained within a space the one-hundred-and-sixty-thousandth
part of a square inch; hence
one square inch of surface would contain little less
than eight millions. These myriads of spores are
shed from the ears, and nothing remains but the
barren matrix in which they were borne when the
farmer proceeds to gather in his crops. At that
time he sees no more of the “smut,” all remembrance
of it for the time is gone, his only thought
is to stack his corn in good condition. But the
millions of spores are dispersed, ten millions at
least for every ear that has been “smutted,”—and
will they not many of them reappear next year,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and thus year after year, with as much certainty as
the grain upon which they are parasitic?</p>

<p class='c008'>Like many of the parasitic fungi, so destructive
in the farm and the garden, this species belongs to
the family in which the spores are the distinctive
feature. After many botanical changes, the “smut”
is at length regarded as a fixed resident in the
genus <i>Ustilago</i>; with the specific name of <i>segetum</i>,
which latter signifies “standing corn;” it is therefore
the <i>Ustilago</i>, or <i>smut of the standing corn</i>. The
characters of the genus are, chiefly, that the spores
are simple and deeply seated, springing from delicate
threads, or in closely-packed cells, ultimately
breaking up into a powdery mass. Fifteen members
of this genus have been described as British.
One of these (<i>U. maydis</i>) attacks the maize or
Indian corn grown in this country in a similar
manner as the common smut attacks wheat or
barley; but as maize is not an established crop
with us, a more minute description of this species
is unnecessary; the spores are figured in <a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a>
fig. 108. Another species (<i>U. hypodytes</i>) makes its
appearance at first beneath the sheaths of the leaves
surrounding the stems of grasses (fig. 100), and
ultimately appears above and around them as a
purplish-black dust (fig. 101). The seeds of sedges,
the leaves and stems of certain definite species of grass,
the flowers of scabious (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> figs. 123-125), the
receptacles of the goatsbeard, the anthers of the
bladder campion, and other allied plants, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>seeds of the Bistort family, are all liable, more or
less, to the attacks of one or other of the residue
of the fifteen species of <i>Ustilago</i> already referred to
as indigenous to Britain.</p>

</div>
<p class='c023'>Although we do not profess to teach practical
men how to grow good corn, or how they shall get
rid of, or keep clear from, the many foes to which
their crops are exposed, yet a suggestion may be
offered, based upon the facts obtained in our
botanical researches, supported by the analogy of
allied circumstances. In this instance the extreme
minuteness and profusion of the spores would evidently
render all the corn liable to the attachment
of, perhaps only two or three, spores to the seed
coat. Some ears of corn in nearer proximity to
the smutted ears may be covered with spores which
yet remain invisible to the naked eye, and when
these grains are mixed with others in the heap, the
chances are not much in favour of any handful not
becoming charged with spores. If the majority of
these were not redeemed from destruction by the
many changes, shiftings, rubbings, and scrubbings
to which the seed corn is liable between the time of
its reaping and the period of its sowing, we might
expect a very large crop of “smutted” corn.
Under ordinary circumstances we can scarcely
imagine that the loss arising from infected ears
would repay much special labour to prevent it, only
that to a large extent the precautions taken to
cleanse the seed corn from the spores of one fungus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>will also avail for another, and while cleaning it of
the spores of “smut,” those of “bunt” will also be
removed. The facts that we rely upon chiefly as
indicating the remedy are that the spores are only
superficially in contact with the seed corn, and that
they are of less specific gravity, causing them to
float on the surface of any fluid in which the corn
may be immersed. Again, the spores of many
species of fungi will not germinate after saturation
with certain chemical solutions. One of the most
successful and easy of application is a strong solution
of Glauber’s salts, in which the seed corn is to
be washed, and afterwards, whilst still moist, dusted
over with quick-lime. The rationale of this process
consists in the setting free of caustic soda by the
sulphuric acid of the Glauber’s salt combining with
the lime, and converting it into sulphate of lime.
The caustic soda is fatal to the germination of the
spores of “bunt,” and probably also of “smut;”
although, as already intimated, except in cases
where these affections of the corn are very prevalent,
we shall be informed by the agriculturist that
the cost of labour in the prevention will not be compensated
in the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Experience has also taught us that many fungi
flourish in proportion to the wetness of the season,
or dampness of the locality. A wet year is always
exceedingly prolific in fungi, and a dry season correspondingly
barren, at least in many kinds, whilst
others, as the experience of 1864 has convinced us, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>exceedingly common. In a field or wood the mycologist
reaps his richest harvest of mycological
specimens in the lowest and dampest spots, in
swamps, ditches, and ill-drained nooks. This is a
fact worth knowing as much by the farmer as the
amateur botanist in search of specimens for his
herbarium.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most unmistakable species of “smut”
is that which infests the goatsbeard, on which we
have already described an <i>Æcidium</i>. Generally
about the same time as the cluster-cups make their
appearance on the leaves, some of the unopened
flower-heads of this plant will be found considerably
altered in appearance by the shortening of the segments
of the involucre, and at length by the whole
inflorescence being invested with a copious purplish-black
dust. If, by any means, the lobes of the involucre
are any of them separated, the enclosed dust
escapes, blackening the fingers and clothing of the
collector, as if it were soot (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 92). A little
of this dust submitted to the microscope will be found
to consist of myriads of small globose spores, nearly
uniform in size and shape; and if a higher power
be employed, each of these will appear to have a
papillose or minutely granulated surface. The
florets, dwarfed in size and contorted, or the remains
of them, are embedded in the mass of spores (fig. 93),
and if one or two of these are removed and placed
under a good one-inch objective, every part will be
found covered with adhering spores, to the apparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>exhaustion of its substance. Of course, the florets
are never developed when subjected to the attack
of “smut.” The whole plant assumes a faded,
sickly appearance, even before the spores are fully
ripened. We would recommend our readers, if they
collect one of the infected flower-heads, to put it
into a box or paper by itself, for if placed in the
box with other specimens it will so sprinkle them
with its black powder as to render them nearly
useless for microscopic examination: everywhere
the microscope will detect, where the unaided eye
failed to recognize a trace, the ubiquitous spores of
<i>Ustilago receptaculorum</i> (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 94).</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fenny districts of the eastern counties a
species of “smut” called <i>Ustilago typhoides</i> attacks
the stems of reeds, forming thick swollen patches
of several inches in length (fig. 128), sometimes
occupying the whole space between two joints or
nodes, and lying beneath the sheath of the leaves.
The spores in this species are larger than in the
species which attacks the culms of grasses in a
similar manner (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> fig. 129).</p>

<p class='c008'>There are not many features in the rest of the
species of this genus of sufficient interest to the
general reader or microscopist to render it advisable
to furnish any detailed account of them. We may,
however, note that in a species found on the leaves
of the common cock’s-foot grass the spores are large,
obovate, and rough, with minute granules (figs. 117,
118). This species is known botanically as <i>Ustilago</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><i>salveii</i>, and externally bears considerable resemblance,
except in the size and colour of the spores
(fig. 119), to another species much more common,
and which occurs on the leaves of <i>Poa aquatica</i> and
<i>P. fluitans</i>. The last-named species forms long
parallel sori, extending often for several inches along
the leaves of the aquatic grasses just named, giving
them a very singular appearance (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> figs. 105,
106). The spores are small (fig. 107), not being more
than one-fourth the length of the last species, and
smooth, whilst those are minutely granulated.</p>

<p class='c008'>An interesting species occurs, very rarely, on
the stems of such grasses as <i>Aira cæspitosa</i> and
<i>A. aquatica</i>. The sori are in bands at regular distances
apart (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> fig. 120), each band being
composed of a number of short parallel sori (fig.
121). The spores are not more than one-third of
the size of those in <i>U. longissima</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sedges are also subject to attack from other
species of smut; one of these (<i>U. olivacea</i>) appears
to convert the seeds into a fine olive-coloured dust
(<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> fig. 126), which gives to the fruit a similar
appearance to that presented by corn when attacked
by <i>Ustilago segetum</i>. Another species, which also absorbs
the seeds, becomes hardened and consolidated
more than in any other species, and, though larger
than the normal seeds, still retaining their form
(figs. 109, 110). This is <i>Ustilago urceolorum</i>, the
spores of which are also figured (fig. 111).</p>

<p class='c008'>The beaksedge (<i>Rhyncospora alba</i>) suffers from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>an allied species which affects it in a similar manner
(<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> figs. 96, 97), but is not equally common.
The spores of <i>Ustilago utriculosa</i>, found on different
species of <i>Polygonum</i>, instead of being granulated,
are reticulated on the surface (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> figs. 114,
116). The chief interest attaching to <i>Ustilago antherarum</i>
consists in its habitat, for it is developed in
the anthers of the flowers of the bladder campion,
and other plants of the same natural order. The
anthers are much swollen and distorted by this
parasite, which is not uncommon, though easily
overlooked unless specially sought after (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a>
figs. 102-104). A list of all the British species will
be found at the close of this volume. It will be noted
that as in the genus <i>Æcidium</i> the prevailing colour
of the spores is orange, so in the genus <i>Ustilago</i> it
is black, with a purplish or violaceous tinge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four diseases in wheat of fungal origin are
known and recognized in the popular language of
the farm as “mildew,” “rust,” “smut,” and
“bunt.” Sometimes one and sometimes another
is most prevalent, and he is an exceedingly fortunate
individual who can walk through his fields
and find only one of them, especially if that one
should be sparingly distributed. It has been our
good fortune to dwell much amongst cornfields, and
the terror of the word “mildew” to a farmer’s ears
is not unfamiliar in our reminiscences of the past,
ere we discarded the much-loved country to become
a dweller in town. The subject of our present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>remarks inspired no such alarm in the districts of
our experience, but in some seasons and localities
it is certainly one of the “pests of the farm.”
Under the different appellations of “bunt,” “pepper
brand,” “bladder brand,” and sometimes “smut,”
this infection is very generally known. Externally
there is no appearance, except to the practised eye,
that anything is wrong. There is no black impalpable
dust about the ears as in the true “smut,”
no red withered leaves or spotted stem as in the
“rust” and “mildew,” and no stunted growth or
malformation, evident to the casual glance, by which
the insidious foe can be recognized; but stealthily
and secretly the work is accomplished, and until
the “bunted” grains make their appearance in the
sample, the disease may, perchance, be unchallenged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Externally the “bunted” grain is plumper, and
whilst the corn is still green these will be of a brighter
green than the rest (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 84). When broken,
the farinaceous interior will be found replaced by a
minute black dust of a very fœtid, unpleasant odour,
and greasy to the touch (fig. 85). This powder
constitutes the spores of the “bunt” mixed with
myceloid threads. It may happen that much of
the corn in a field is “bunted,” and the discovery
not made till the wheat is being ground for flour;
then the odour and colour will speedily decide the
produce to be unfit for human food. We have not
the least doubt that “bunted” corn, when ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with flour, is injurious in proportion to its extent,
whilst at the same time we can scarcely conceive an
intelligent miller grinding up a sample containing
any large proportion of “bunted” grains in ignorance
of the fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we break open a grain of wheat infested with
the “stinking rust” or “bunt,” and then place
some of the powder in a drop of water on a glass
slide, and submit this to the microscope, first using
the half-inch power, then the quarter, or fifth, and
finally an eighth or tenth, we shall find that this
minute dust consists of myriads of globose brown
bodies termed spores, which possess certain reproductive
functions. These spores will be found
mixed with a number of delicate branched threads,
to which they are attached by a short stalk or
pedicel, visible with the higher powers (fig. 86).
The surface of the spores you will also observe to
be beautifully reticulated. These features just
described as visible in the “bunt” are the characteristics
of the genus to which it belongs (<i>Tilletea</i>),
and of which it is the only British species. An
allied species infests the Sorghum or durra, a grain
but little cultivated in Europe, but found extensively
in Africa and Asia, and also apparently found

Berkeley on the germination of “bunt” spores
have been already alluded to. They were undertaken
shortly after the outbreak of the potato
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>disease, to ascertain, if possible, the mode by which
the minute spores of fungi inoculate growing
plants; and although at that time only a bare
suspicion of the nature of the bodies resulting from
the germination of “bunt” spores was entertained,
succeeding examinations in the same direction
have brought to light extraordinary facts, and
manifested the progress of the successive developments
of four generations. The spores of “bunt” are
larger than those of the different species of “smut,”
and reticulated on the surface (<a href='#i080'>Plate V.</a> fig. 86).
When these are made to germinate a kind of stem
is protruded (fig. 87), upon which small clusters of
elongated thread-like spores of the second generation,
or sporidia, are produced (fig. 88). After
a time these spores conjugate, or become united
by short transverse processes in the same manner
as has been observed in some of the lower forms
of Algæ (fig. 89). The conjugated spores in the
next stage germinate and produce a third kind of
fruit, different from either of the preceding, and
constituting a third generation (fig. 90). These
in turn germinate and produce a fourth order of
reproductive organs (fig. 91), so that in the process
of growth the “bunt” spores evidently pass
through four generations. Hence, as one result,
the number of germinating bodies is greatly increased,
as well as their power of inflicting injury
in a corresponding diminution in size. There are
still many points in the history of the growth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>development through successive generations of the
“bunt” spores, but enough is known, on the one
hand, to show that this is a true vegetative parasite,
and not merely a diseased condition of the tissues
of the wheat plant, and on the other that it is
perfectly distinct from all the phases of the other
and similar parasitic fungi which affect the wheat
crop.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>SOME of the microscopic fungi are the most
unpromising and uninteresting objects to the
naked eye which could well be imagined. No one
would suppose that the black dust so profusely
shed in such genera as <i>Ustilago</i> and <i>Polycystis</i>
could be better than as much soot; unless he has
learnt by experience not to judge by appearances,
but to suspend judgment until examination. The
axiom will sooner or later force itself upon all who
examine minute objects with the microscope, that
all organic nature, whether animal or vegetable,
increases in interest in proportion to the magnifying
power. Seen by the unaided eye, <i>moulds</i> are
all nearly alike, and they seem to be “moulds”
and nothing more. “Smuts,” again, sometimes
attack one organ, and sometimes another, with
very little variation in colour; and “rusts” are all
“only rusts” with a paler or more intense rusty
tint, until the marvellous combination of lenses, so
appropriately named a <i>microscope</i>, unfolds a new
world, and exposes its new inhabitants unparalleled
in the old world of larger life, in form, habit, development,
and mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very interesting, though small group of fungi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>allied to the preceding, are included botanically
under the genus called <i>Polycystis</i>, in allusion to the
many cells of which the spores are composed.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In
the most recent work on British Fungi, approximating
to a Flora—viz., “Berkeley’s Outlines”—only
three species are recorded, whilst the most
common, at least around London, is omitted in
error; for it could scarcely have been unknown as
indigenous to this country. This last is the crow-foot
smut (<i>Polycystis pompholygodes</i>, Lev.), found
on the leaves and petioles of the common creeping
buttercup (<i>Ranunculus repens</i>), distorting them
very much, and also occurring on the wood-anemone
and some other Ranunculaceous plants. The leaves
and their footstalks, when attacked, become swollen,
as if blistered at first, and ultimately burst in an
irregular manner, exposing a mass of blackish
soot-like dust (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 183), which on examination
will be found to consist of the many-celled
spores alluded to (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 184). Each of
these spores appears to have a transparent outer
membrane, either enclosing an unequal number,
from two or three to five or six, distinct cells,
compressed together into a spherical form by the
outer integument, or the interior is divided by
septa into as many cells. Each of these divisions
contains a dark brownish endochrome, or cell-contents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>As may be anticipated, the spores in all
the species associated in this genus are interesting
objects for the microscope. The species on the
buttercup may be found through the summer and
autumn on <i>Ranunculus repens</i>, especially whenever
that plant is met with in very damp situations.
We have seldom found the plant in any profusion
without its attendant fungus.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f6'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rabenhorst has proposed <i>Urocystis</i> as the name of this
genus, on the ground that <i>Polycystis</i> was priorly applied to a
genus of Algæ.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Another species of these many-celled smuts is
not uncommon in gardens, on the sweet violet,
attacking the footstalks of the leaves more commonly
than the leaves themselves, and swelling and
contorting them (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 185). In general
structure the spores are very similar to those of
the last species, save that the cells are smaller,
and a larger number are collected together (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a>
fig. 186). So far as we have yet examined the
spores of this and the preceding species, they
appear to consist of separate and distinct vesicles
(probably spores), contained within a hyaline sac
or outer membrane, and <i>not</i> to be a single spore
divided into cells by numerous septa.</p>

<p class='c008'>A species of equal interest (<i>Polycystis Colchici</i>,
Tul.) is found on the autumnal crocus, or meadow-saffron
(<i>Colchicum autumnale</i>). The spores approach
nearer to those of the last than of the prior
species.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fourth species occurs on the leaves of rye
(<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 187), forming elongated parallel
blackish lines (<i>Polycystis parallela</i>, B. &amp; Br.). It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>has also been found on the leaves of some grasses,
but does not appear to be very common.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many similar features are possessed by the two
members of a genus named <i>Tubercinia</i>, which have
been found in this country. One of the species
is parasitic upon a plant which we who inhabit
southern England never meet with, but which is
not uncommon in Scotland, <i>i. e.</i>, <i>Trientalis Europæa</i>.
The parasite attacks the leaves about the month of
September, forming bullate or blistered patches
one-eighth to one-sixth of an inch broad, containing
a mass of black spores (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 52).
These spores are irregularly globose, large, and
opaque, consisting of a number of distinct cells
(<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 53). Never having seen other than
dried specimens—kindly communicated by Dr.
Dickie of Aberdeen, the discoverer of this species—we
cannot add much to its history beyond the
published description by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other species occurs on potatoes, and is,
during some seasons, common in all parts of Great
Britain. The spores are curious, being composed
of a number of cells arranged in the form of a
hollow sphere, with one or two apertures communicating
with the interior (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 54). They
are generally attached by a delicate thread. This
species, sometimes confounded with the potato
scab, was first described by Mr. Berkeley, about
the time of the appearance of the “potato disease,”
with which, however, it is in no way connected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Thus it will be seen that, inasmuch as we have
complex brands in which the number of cells are
considerably increased, so have we “complex smuts”
in which, instead of one cell, we have many. In
the last instance the two genera associated together
in this chapter agree. The spores in both are
distinctly cellular, but in the last genus far more
opaque and consolidated than in the first. Whilst
it may be doubted whether the compound spores of
<i>Polycystis</i> are anything more than a number of
individual spores with a gregarious habit, invested
with an outer membrane, such a hypothesis cannot
(as far as our individual examinations extend), be
made to include <i>Tubercinia</i>. No doubt has yet
been thrown on the genuine character of either of
these genera. No <i>Uredo</i> or <i>Æcidium</i>, no <i>Trichobasis</i>
or <i>Puccinia</i> has been ascertained or suspected to
appear as a prior or subsequent form. In their
supposed integrity they offer an interesting study,
and in their development a good subject for investigation.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>UNFORTUNATELY, this group of fungi contains
species but too well known for their
ravages amongst graminaceous plants, especially
the cereals. “Corn rust,” as it is generally called,
has a reputation little better than mildew, and it
really deserves no better, for it is only another form
of that pest of the farm, from the mycelium of
which the corn-mildew is at length developed.
There are two species very closely allied (doubtless
only forms of the same species with different spores)
which attack the leaves and culms of growing corn,
and, bursting through the cuticle in the manner
represented in <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 141 (magnified), give
a peculiar rusty appearance to the plant, as represented
in <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 140. One of these corn-rusts
is botanically named <i>Trichobasis rubigo-vera</i> (Lev.),
or the “true rust <i>Trichobasis</i>;” the latter, which is
the generic name, being a compound of two Greek
words (<i>thrix</i>, a hair, and <i>basis</i>, a foundation), on
account of the spores being at first furnished at
their base with a short, thread-like peduncle, which
at length falls away (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 142). The
other Corn rust is <i>Trichobasis linearis</i>, or “line-like
<i>Trichobasis</i>,” because the sori or pustules are linear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>or lengthened out like a line; the spores nearly
double the length of those of the other Corn rust
(<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 144), and not so bright in colour.
By intermediate forms these two rusts pass insensibly
the one into the other, so that it is sometimes
difficult to distinguish them. Both have the spores
clustered together in the pustules, at first (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 143) attached by their peduncles, but they soon
become free, and are scattered like rust-powder
over the plant. Adverting to the attack of rust
upon the wheat crops to an unusual extent a few
years since, the Rev. M. J. Berkeley wrote as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c026'>We have seen rust more prevalent in white wheats, especially
in the variety called Russian white, which has red smooth chaff,
than we ever remember it. It is, however, confined to particular
spots; and while in one field not a single leaf is free,
insomuch that a person walking through the wheat is completely
painted with the spores, of a fine rust-red; an adjoining
field, separated only by a hedge, has not a rusty leaf. So long,
however, as the rust is confined to the leaf, it is, we believe,
perfectly harmless. The grain swells in spite of it, and the
only effect is that the flag dies a little earlier, which is not
undesirable when it is too luxuriant. If, however, it gets to any
extent upon the chaff, much more if it attacks the seed itself,
as is sometimes the case, it is very mischievous.</p>
<div id='i096'  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic001'>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c027'>There is, indeed, a notion that rust is merely a form of mildew,
and this may be true; but if so, it is a harmless form. The
true rust (<i>T. rubigo-vera</i>), if a form of mildew, preserves its own
characters to the end, and merely presents a second form of
fruit, a circumstance which is exceedingly common amongst the
lower fungi. It may exist in company with the mildew, but it
also more frequently is developed without a trace of mildew
intermixed. As far, then, as its immediate effects upon the plant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>go, it may be treated as a distinct parasite, though advanced
botanists may look upon it as offering a case of what they call
dualism, which may be easily understood on a comparison with
such plants as marigold and orache, which produce seeds of
two different forms. Its ultimate effects may, indeed, be injurious,
as, if it be really a second form of mildew, it is capable
of propagating that pest. The case is quite different with
<i>Trichobasis linearis</i>, which is in fact merely the young state of
the mildew. When once that supposed species makes its
appearance, it is quite certain that there will be mildew to a
greater or less extent. While the spores of the one remain
unaltered, though intermixed with the true bipartite spores of
the mildew, the other exhibits every intermediate state of form
and colour.</p>

<p class='c022'>M. Tulasne, to whom we have already alluded as
a high authority on this subject, is of opinion that
all the species enumerated in this group or genus,
are mere conditions of other species, and therefore
excludes it altogether. Another genus (<i>Lecythea</i>),
for the same reason, has shared the same fate.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must not be forgotten that twenty-eight species
of rust belonging to this genus are now recorded
as occurring in Great Britain. Some of these have
yellow or yellowish spores; the rest have the spores
of a decidedly brown colour. One of the most
attractive of the yellow-spored species is that which
appears on the groundsel (<i>T. Senecionis</i>), and a
good notion of its external appearance may be
gained from our figure (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 145). It is
not always to be found without searching closely,
for in some localities we have found it very sparingly,
whilst elsewhere—as, for instance, on Wandsworth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Common—we have met with it as soon or as
late as there were groundsel leaves for it to grow
upon. No spot or change in the appearance of the
upper surface of the leaves indicates the presence
of the parasite beneath; this is, however, often
betrayed by the golden-yellow streaks which appear
on the stem. Many a time and oft the boys in the
semi-rural districts about town have marvelled and
questioned each other concerning the reason why,
in gathering “groundsel” for the little bird at
home, we should be so particular, and pass so many
promising plants, plucking here and there a leaf,
and seldom collecting one which they consider
eligible for the purpose. Collectors of minute
fungi must expect to overhear occasionally even
hints touching their sanity from those who, without
the remotest idea of their mission, think they must
be slightly “wrong in the head” to gaze so narrowly
and intently, amongst nettles, groundsel,
grass, or dry leaves, and only take an occasional
fragment of a rotten stick, or two or three sickly
leaves, carefully deposit them in their wallet, hat,
or pocket, and then “move on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be unnecessary to repeat what has been
stated in a former chapter on spermogones. It will
be remembered that these organs are found developed
in connection with some of the species of the
present genus, as well as with the cluster-cups, or
<i>Æcidiacei</i>. They consist externally of small conical
elevations, pierced at the apex, which contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>minute, cellular, linear bodies called spermatia, invested
with a kind of mucous substance, that over-flows
with them from the orifice of the spermogone,
like lava from the crater of a miniature volcano.
The rust in company with which they have been
found most plentifully, is that which covers the
under surface of the leaves of the commonest of
all thistles (<i>Cnicus arvensis</i>). The external form of
one of these spermogones is figured <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 153. The rust possesses, when fresh, a peculiar
odour, which is said to resemble that of orange-flowers;
whence was derived its name of “sweet-smelling
rust” (<i>Trichobasis suaveolens</i>, Lev.). M.
Tulasne writes:—“With respect to this species, it
is, in my opinion, but the first form of a <i>Puccinia</i>,
analogous to <i>P. Compositarum</i>, D.C.: the spermogones
with which it is mixed being very abundant,
it ought to be placed with that <i>Puccinia</i>. I should,
perhaps, retain some doubts upon the legitimacy
of this relationship, if it had not been my fortune
to meet on another species of the same kind (<i>Puccinia
Anemones</i>, P.) spermogones perfectly characterized,
and in which the colour, habit, and position
would not allow me to hesitate an instant in attributing
them to the <i>Puccinia</i>.” In this species of
rust the whole under surface of the leaf is covered
with a purplish-brown dusty coating of the spores,
from the numerous pustules which are produced
(<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 151). The plants, when attacked,
have a paler and more sickly appearance; the leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>have a tendency to fold backwards at their margins,
and thenceforth their growth seems to be
determined. Sowerby, in his “British Fungi,”
says:—“Two or three sorts of flies are occasionally
found dead on this plant at the time of the
fungus being upon it, which is after wet weather in
the summer, or early in autumn; being apparently
tempted by its flavour, they over-eat themselves,
or else are destroyed by some poison.” This rust
has spores resembling, in general characters, those
of the yellow-spored series <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 152).</p>

<p class='c008'>We have not thought it necessary to give figures
of many species, partly on account of the uncertainty
existing in many minds whether they ought
to be regarded as species, and whether they will
long claim a place in the British Flora; and partly
on account of the similarity which exists between
them, at least so far as they are of interest to the
microscopist only.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the autumn of last year, whilst on a
botanical excursion through a portion of Epping
Forest, the “great bog” became a centre of some
interest. Bogs are generally attractive spots to
those who are in search of microscopic organisms.
On this occasion the chief objects of interest were
the small brown pustules (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 168) with
which the upper surface of a large number of the
leaves of the pennywort (<i>Hydrocotyle vulgaris</i>) were
sprinkled. These pustules were brown, orbicular,
regular, and in habit seemed to resemble rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>those of most of the <i>Pucciniæ</i> than of a <i>Trichobasis</i>.
The large, vigorous, and healthy leaves were less
affected. Microscopical examination, at first incomplete,
led us to the conclusion that it was a species
of <i>Uredo</i>, which had been met with in France
(<i>Uredo Hydrocotyles</i>, Mont.); but a re-examination,
to which we were prompted by Mr. Currey, led to
the conclusion that it belonged rather to the present
genus; but it can scarcely be associated with
any species already described, notwithstanding its
apparent affinity with the brown rust found on
umbelliferous plants, in which the pustules are invariably
developed on the <i>under</i> surface. Under
these circumstances, we have called it the Pennywort
rust (<i>Trichobasis Hydrocotyles</i>), whilst still
doubtful whether it is not the same fungus as that
described by Montagne, with whose description it
agrees in everything, except what is implied by
the generic name. It should not be forgotten,
that the work in which Montagne first described
this species was published when the genus <i>Uredo</i>
embraced the present genus, which was separated
from it by Leveille twelve years later; and it is
possible that this species was included in a more
recent work by the same author, in error and
without re-examination, under the old name. An
examination of authentic specimens of Montagne’s
plant would settle the point; but we know of no
published collection which contains it. The characteristic
difference between the two genera lies in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the presence of a peduncle in the early stage of
<i>Trichobasis</i> <a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 169), and its absence
in all stages of <i>Uredo</i>. Without wandering further
into a subject which has not the merit of
being very popular, let us away to some green
lane in search of violets, and having found them,
take a little of the brown dust from one of the
small pustules on the leaves, upon the point of a
penknife; place this, with a drop of water, upon a
glass slide, and make a record of what we observe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The field is covered with the myriad spores of a
rust of a nearly spherical shape, brownish in colour,
and here and there one with a short transparent
colourless stalk or pedicel. This is the violet rust
(<i>Trichobasis Violarum</i>, B.), very common all through
the summer and autumn, generally on the under
surface of the leaves of violets, in woods and
hedgerows. Should it so happen that the spores
when placed under the microscope are found to be
two-celled, it will prove that instead of a rust, or
<i>Trichobasis</i>, being under examination, a brand, or
<i>Puccinia</i>, has been found, which is almost equally
common, and which may, without such a test, be
easily mistaken for a rust. According to the theory
of di-morphism, this is the higher form or complete
fruit of the same fungus, which in its simple-celled
state is called <i>Trichobasis Violarum</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A similar circumstance may befall the student in
examining the rust of labiate plants (<i>Trichobasis
Labiatarum</i>, Lev.), which occurs on different species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of mint, especially the water-mint, about the month
of August. We have found a few of the two-celled
spores of the <i>Puccinia</i> imbedded in the pustules of
this rust almost constantly, whilst the one-celled
spores are not uncommon in the pustules of what
is regarded as the true mint brand (<i>Puccinia Menthæ</i>,
P.).</p>

<p class='c008'>In spring the young leaves of the periwinkle
(<i>Vinca major</i>) will, in some situations, become
thickened considerably, and ultimately browned on
both faces with the pustules of a rust (<i>Trichobasis
Vincæ</i>), which though covered with a conidioid dust
are often very tardy in bursting the epidermis. It
is almost impossible, after the pustule is ruptured,
to find one in which the bilocular spores of <i>Puccinia</i>
(fig. 132) are not largely intermingled with the
unilocular spores of the “rust” (<a href='#i096'>Plate VI.</a> fig. 131).
Later in the season by two or three months, other
leaves of the same plants will be found occupied
by the smaller and more widely scattered pustules
of <i>Puccinia Vincæ</i>, in which the unilocular spores of
the “rust” will seldom be found. In this instance
the leaves are scarcely thickened, and the colour of
the spores is much darker. The under surface of
the leaves is commonly alone occupied, and corresponding
paler spots on the upper surface indicate
the presence of the parasite beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>The garden and field bean is liable in some seasons
to become quite rust-coloured in consequence
of the profusion of spores with which the leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and stems are covered, from the bean rust (<i>Trichobasis
Fabæ</i>, Lev.), which in like manner is considered
as the simple stage or form of the bean
brand (<i>Puccinia Fabæ</i>, Lk.). If the legumes are
also examined, a few pustules will sometimes be
found on them. Beans thoroughly infected with
this rust or brand are seldom of much service in
either field or garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beetroot, or mangold wurzel, is another example
of garden and field produce which is subject to a
similar visitation. This rust often has very red
spores when produced on red varieties of beet.
During September, 1863, it (<i>Trichobasis Betæ</i>, Lev.)
was sent us on the leaves of the wild beet (<i>Beta
maritima</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>All the species of <i>Polygonum</i> are exceedingly
subject to the attacks of the Persicaria rust (<i>Trichobasis
Polygonorum</i>, B.), which nearly covers the
leaves, till the entire plants seem to be smothered
in Scotch snuff. If it were allowable to affirm of
any plants that they are martyrs to parasitism, such
might be said of the Persicarias and their allies.</p>
<div id='i104'  class='figcenter id008'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Plate VIII.<br />W. West imp.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c023'>Sedges are subject to the attacks of a rust much
resembling the corn rust. When it occurs on some
species of <i>Carex</i>, the upper surface of the leaf has
corresponding pale spots, and the pustules themselves
are surrounded by a yellowish margin. This
species (<i>Trichobasis caricina</i>) is far from uncommon
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> figs. 170, 171). The sedge-like plants
belonging to the genus <i>Luzula</i> have also their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>species of rust (<i>Trichobasis oblongata</i>), the spores of
which are deeper in colour than in the sedge rust
(<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> figs. 158, 159).</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the remaining species of <i>Trichobasis</i>
(the reader must pardon our using the generic
name, as we have no equivalent), that found on
the leaves of various composite plants is the most
common (<i>Trichobasis Cichoracearum</i>, Lev.). It
occurs on some thistles, on the saw-wort, dandelion,
several species of hawkweed, and similar plants.
The pustules are small and more diffused than in
the species found on <i>Cnicus arvensis</i>, and they as
often appear on the upper as on the lower surfaces
of the leaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>On umbelliferous plants three species are recorded;
one with yellow spores (<i>Trichobasis Petroselini</i>,
B.); another with a blistered habit, and
brown, ovate, or oblong spores (<i>T. Umbellatarum</i>,
Lev.); and a third with tawny, obovate, or egg-shaped
spores (<i>T. Heraclei</i>, B.), which is found
solely on the cow-parsnip. The species of <i>Puccinia</i>
corresponding to some of these species of
<i>Trichobasis</i> are known, but, in other cases, probability,
or speculation if you please, occupies the
place of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the month of September, 1864, it was
our good fortune to spend a week in revisiting the
scenes of our boyhood, and exploring the minute
botany of one of the marshy districts of East Norfolk.
One day of the seven, memorable to us for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the discovery of three specimens of a large Boletus
(<i>B. cyanescens</i>),<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a> not found, to our knowledge, since
the days of Sibthorpe, was further enriched by a
species of <i>Trichobasis</i>, new to Britain, and apparently
uncommon on the Continent. This rust was found
on the leaves of the “grass of Parnassus” (<i>Parnassia
palustris</i>) on a narrow strip of marsh near
Irstead church. It was sought in vain elsewhere.
The leaves were scarcely changed in appearance,
except by the presence of the pustules. There were
no discoloured spots, but the pustules appeared
sometimes plentifully, more often scattered, on both
surfaces of the leaves: they were small, of a bright
brown, with oval spores; the latter were, in their
early stages, shortly stalked. We have called this
species <i>Trichobasis Parnassiæ</i>. It is possibly the
same as published by Westendorp in his “Herbier
Cryptogamique Belge” as <i>Uredo Parnassiæ</i>, but we
know of no copy which we can consult, and have
failed in discovering any other species to which we
can refer it. It is certainly a <i>Trichobasis</i> and not
an <i>Uredo</i>, according to the present limitation of the
latter genus.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f7'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two of these specimens were found at the bottom of a
hedge-bank, amongst grass, by the side of the road leading from
Neatishead-street to Irstead Rectory, and the third in a similar
position by the Norwich road, two hundred yards from the
turning which leads to Neatishead-street.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Although the evidence against the retention of
the species of <i>Lecythea</i> (as the genus is named)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>amongst Fungi as true species, on the ground of
di-morphism, is even stronger than against the
group just illustrated, we cannot pass them altogether
in silence, especially in a popular treatise. Those
who are residents in town, and yet possess their
little plot of garden-ground, with only two or three
pet roses, may have had the misfortune of seeing
them smothered with a yellow blight. This golden
visitation, unwelcome as it is, may afford a subject
for the microscope, and for a small space in this
chapter. At first there will not appear to be any
important difference between the spores of the
yellow series of the last genus and those of the
present; but a closer examination will reveal one
important distinction, viz., the presence of colourless
elongated, abortive spores. The species are not so
numerous by half as those of <i>Trichobasis</i>, even when
three anomalous forms are included, which species
are included by some mycologists in two other
genera. One very common rust of this group has
already been alluded to (<a href='#i032'>Plate II.</a> fig. 37), and
which is known botanically as <i>Lecythea Rosæ</i>. A
similar one is found on the bramble, and another on
the burnet. All these three species are produced
at first on spots which are afterwards more or less
occupied by the long, many-celled spores of the
dark brown brands called <i>Aregma</i> or <i>Phragmidium</i>,
between which and the simple yellow spores of the
rust almost every intermediate form may often be
found in the same pustule. Thus, from the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>mycelium as that of the rose rust, the rose brand is
afterwards developed; whilst from the nidus of the
bramble rust (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 40) the bramble brand
is also at length produced; and the successor to the
burnet rust (<a href='#i048'>Plate III.</a> fig. 31) is the burnet brand.
Besides these, a rust belonging to the same genus
may be found on the leaves of the poplar, the spurge,
and the common valerian, and two or three species
on willows. It can scarcely have escaped notice,
that the goat-willow is almost constantly afflicted
with a rust on the under surface of the leaves
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 160). This species will again come
under notice as the summer spores of a truly
dimorphous species.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the rusts separated by some botanists from
this genus is found (possibly most commonly) on
the leaves of the raspberry; but during the past
autumn we have met with it plentifully on the upper
surface of the leaves of one or two species of bramble,
and have never seen it growing on the raspberry,
although in all descriptions of the species that is
stated to be its habitat. Even to the naked eye
this is so distinct, that no one could well confound
it with any other. It appears very late in the
autumn, and the spots are scattered at some distance
apart from each other (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 162);
each spot or pustule forming a ring (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a>
fig. 163 enlarged) encircling a cluster of spermogones
which occupy the centre.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another rejected species (<i>Lecythea Lini</i>, Lev.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>occurs on the little purging flax (<i>Linum catharticum</i>),
forming small pustules on the leaves (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a>
fig. 165); these burst irregularly, and remain surrounded
by the remains of the ruptured epidermis
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 166). The yellowish spores are
subglobose (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 167), and in the first
instance concatenate, or chained together like a
necklace, which circumstance has been taken advantage
of to place it, with one or two other species,
in a separate genus.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot claim for the species brought into
notice in the present chapter any attractive features
resulting from singularity of form, complexity of
structure, or delicate tracery, whereby they might
commend themselves to mere “searchers after
curiosities,” or be recommended from friend to
friend as “sensation” objects for the microscope.
They <i>do</i> possess an interest and a value, but such
as would not be appreciated by those who seek
to pass an idle half-hour by gazing at some new
thing.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>A QUARTER of a century ago, and all the fungi
enumerated in the preceding and in the present
and following chapters would have been
arranged under three genera, called respectively
<i>Æcidium</i>, <i>Puccinia</i>, and <i>Uredo</i>. Under the last-named
genus all the species illustrated in the present
chapter, beside many others, would have found
“a habitation and a name.” There are still a few
which bear the old generic name, and, if only out of
respect, we shall grant them the first place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let the first bright day in May witness the
student beside a cluster of plants of <i>Mercurialis
perennis</i>, which it will not be difficult to find in
many localities, and, on turning up the lower
leaves, he will meet with our first illustration of
a genuine <i>Uredo</i>, in the form of yellow confluent
patches, with a powdery surface (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 133). This will be <i>Uredo confluens</i>. By the
way, the generic name is in itself suggestive,
which it always should be in all instances, but
unfortunately is not; it is derived from the Latin
word <i>uro</i>, “I burn,” and is peculiarly applicable
in instances where the leaves acquire a blistered,
burnt, or scorched appearance, occasioned by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>presence of the fungus. The microscopical features
of the spores of this genus are, briefly, a more or
less spherical form, without any pedicel or footstalk
<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 134). These spores are at first
produced each in a separate cell, but when ripe
become free, and are at times with difficulty distinguished
from such forms as <i>Trichobasis</i>, unless
the pedicels in the early stage of the latter genus
are regarded.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rare species in Britain is the oak-leaf rust
(<i>Uredo Quercus</i>), in which the sori or pustules are
minute, and at first yellow, but afterwards orange.
It occurs on the under surface of the leaves, and
was, we believe, first found in this country by Mr.
D. Stock, in the neighbourhood of Bungay, nearly
five-and-twenty years since. That gentleman informs
us that it was not at all uncommon, but
always appeared on the young shoots which had
sprung up from the trunks or roots of trees that
had been cut down. We are uncertain whether it
has been found by any one since that time in this
country, although it is not uncommon in France.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leaves of the common sorrel are often
sparely sprinkled with the pustules of a rust
(<i>Uredo bifrons</i>, Grev.), which derives its specific
name from the fact that the pustules, which appear
on both surfaces of the leaves, are often opposite
to each other <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 137). These pustules
are generally seated on a discoloured spot (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 138 enlarged), and are surrounded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>remains of the ruptured epidermis. The spores are
globose and brown <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 139). We have
not met with any other <i>Uredine</i> on the sorrel
leaves, though one having a similar appearance
to the naked eye is not uncommon on several
species of dock.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fern rust (<i>Uredo Filicum</i>), which occurs on
the under surface of the fronds of two or three
species of ferns, we have never met with, and do not
think that it can be considered common. It has
been found in the West of England, on <i>Cystopteris</i>,
and Sowerby collected it, probably not very far
from London.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most common is the rust found on
the leaves of the enchanter’s nightshade (<i>Circæa
lutetiana</i>), sometimes nearly covering the under surface
with its tawny snuff-coloured spores <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 135). The plant on which it is found is rather
local, but the rust (<i>Uredo Circææ</i>) seems to abound
wherever the plant on which it is parasitic flourishes.
Another fungus of a very similar external appearance
may be collected, more rarely, from the leaves
of the same plant; but in this the spores are two-celled,
or divided by a transverse partition. This
fact is mentioned to guard against disappointment,
should the spores be found to differ from the
characters of this section, and to show that the
microscope is essential to the study of fungi. The
spores of the true Uredo are globose and without
any partition <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 136).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>We may also observe that a very interesting
species may be found on several species of St.
John’s-wort (<i>Hypericum</i>), but especially on the
under surface of the leaves of the Tutsan, covering
them with its golden-coloured spores (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a>
fig. 174). Another occurs on the leaves of some
of the wild garlics (<i>Allium</i>); one is not uncommon
on some of the stitchworts; another on saxifrages;
another on willow-herbs (<i>Epilobium</i>), and one on the
leaves of the cowberry. All of these have yellowish
spores. A species with brown spores occurs on
sea-lavender (<i>Statice</i>). Space to write on our own
part, and patience to read on the part of others,
induce us to dismiss all these species with the
bare allusion to them and the plants on which
they may be found. Some of them may occur in
one locality and some in another, and enough has
perhaps been said to enable any one to place any
that he may find in the proper genus, if not with
the scientific name.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the numerous instances we have met with
of persons wholly disinterested in the subject,
collecting and making inquiries concerning the
bright orange patches next to be referred to, we
are led to conclude that most persons have, at
least, seen them. These patches of orange-coloured
powder burst through the cuticle, and appear on
the young branches of wild roses, extending sometimes
for two or three inches in length <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 147), and form one of the most beautiful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>obtrusive of the dust-like fungi. It is not confined
to roses; but the meadow-sweet, on which it is
also found, does not grow in localities where its
parasite is so liable to meet the gaze of the ordinary
wayfarer. The habit of this rust is more or less
that of those which are associated with it. The
pustules are not small and orbicular as in most
instances in other groups (except <i>Polycystis</i>), but
are large and irregular, and generally but few
together or single. The spores are variously coloured,
and have peduncles, or footstalks, of a
greater or less length. In the rose rust these
spores are profuse, but the peduncle is short (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a>
fig. 148).</p>

<p class='c008'>Plants of the pea and bean tribe are liable to
be attacked by one of these rusts, and in this instance
the spores are so characteristic that no one
could well confound them with any other. Externally
it appears as an irregular brownish pustule,
breaking through the epidermis and filled with an
impalpable powder, not unlike a pinch of “brown
rappee” snuff. The spores are ovoid, with a very
long peduncle, whence its name (<i>Uromyces appendiculata</i>).
It appears on a great variety of plants, but
from the peculiarity of the spores <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig.
150), is easily recognized. Our figure represents
it on the leaf of a vetch (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 149).
Almost at the commencement of this volume
(<a href='#ch03'>Chap. III.</a>) we had occasion to refer in detail to
some experiments made by De Bary on the spores
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of this species. In the remarks then made occurs
a recommendation of reperusal, which would obviate
any repetition here.</p>

<p class='c008'>An allied species, and a beautiful one, is to be
found on the stinking iris (<i>Iris fœtidissima</i>), and
another on the under surface of the leaves of
primroses.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pilewort (<i>Ranunculus ficaria</i>) we have already
seen attacked by one species of microscopic fungi,
and we have now to record the occurrence of another.
Some plants appear to be destined both alive and
dead to become the prey of others. The common
nettle, for instance, as if in retribution for the
annoyance it often occasions on account of its
stinging propensities, has not less than twenty
different species of minute fungi, to say nothing
of coleopterous and lepidopterous insects, which
make a home, sometimes upon its green leaves, and
sometimes on its dead stems. We might almost
state that it has a flora and a fauna of its own.
The pilewort, too, has many foes; but these are
fewer in number, and mostly attack the living
plant. The cluster-cups have been already noticed;
some do not fall within the limits of this volume,
but one, which is found in May and June, belongs
to the present genus. It appears like a purplish-brown
powder bursting through blistered spots on
the leaves and footstalks <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 156).
The spores are small, and are, of course, provided
with pedicels <a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 157).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The under surface of the leaves of the white
Dutch clover are often sprinkled with black spots,
which are nearly round and very numerous. These
are so many clusters of fungi belonging to a
different section, in which the threads are the
important feature. But another parasite is also
found on leaves of the same plant, in which the
pustules are far less numerous and regular, and
are often found on the petiole as well as the leaf,
distorting them and twisting them in various directions
<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 154). This is the clover rust
(<i>Uromyces apiculata</i>, Lev.), which is a parasite on
numerous plants, being found also on the great
water-dock and other kinds of dock. The spores
are ovoid and brown, with a short peduncle (<a href='#frontis'>Plate VII.</a> fig. 155). A very beautiful species occurs on
the leaves of the ladies-mantle (<i>Alchemilla</i>), but
hitherto we have not been fortunate enough to
collect it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It can scarcely be too great an assumption to
suppose that every one is acquainted with the goat-willow
(<i>Salix caprea</i>), or that every schoolboy
knows the birch (<i>Betula alba</i>). It may be proceeding
a step too far to affirm that all who know
these trees well enough to distinguish the one from
the other, will have observed the under surfaces of
the leaves of both sprinkled with a golden dust,
during the summer months, and which are the
spores of a parasitic fungus. So common is this
orange-coloured powder on leaves of the trees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>above-named, that we can hardly believe any one
to have had a branch of either in his hand and not
observed it, provided any leaves adorned the branch
in question. What this parasite is, and what its
associates, it is our province to endeavour to explain.
Our figure (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 160) represents
a leaf of the sallow or goat-willow, with the under
surface exhibiting yellow patches, consisting of
spores, which are magnified in the next figure
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 161). This exceedingly common
rust is termed <i>Lecythea caprearum</i>, Lev., when in
the condition figured; but in reality this is only the
summer stage, bearing the summer fruit of <i>Melampsora
salicina</i>, which latter attains its mature
development on the same leaves in the succeeding
winter (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 191) or early spring. Of
course this latter remark applies to the fallen leaves,
for at this period all the willows and other deciduous
trees are bare. But the leaves, before they fall,
give evidence of the parasite at work; and if the
collected decaying mass of rubbish at the base of
sallow bushes be examined about March, these
leaves will be found bearing upon them mature
heaps of elongated, wedge-shaped spores, closely
packed side by side (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 192), and which,
whilst still adherent, may often be found in active
germination, as represented in an allied species at
the bottom of our plate (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> fig. 197). This
phenomenon consists in the production of cylindrical
tubes, more or less elongated, from the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>extremity (rarely from the base) of the prismatic
spores. These tubes are straight or twisted, simple
or forked, and each of them becomes divided by
transverse septa into four unequal cells towards their
apex, from each of which is produced a spicule
bearing a sporidium, or spherical secondary fruit,
in the same manner as in the genera <i>Puccinia</i> and
<i>Aregma</i>. It should be observed, that the winter
spores of this rust are borne on the opposite surface
of the leaves to the summer spores: for whilst
the latter are developed from the under surface, the
former are found on the upper. This being also an
instance of di-morphism, the summer condition,
when spherical spores are produced, should not be
regarded as a distinct plant, and the name of
<i>Lecythea caprearum</i> does not merit retention in the
list of fungi.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are five species of this interesting group,
or genus, found in Great Britain, to the residue of
which we may only briefly allude. It has already
been stated that, in summer, the yellow spores of a
rust are found on the under surface of birch-leaves.
These must be sought on the young twigs or
suckers, proceeding from the stumps of trees which
have been cut down: pale discoloured spots on the
upper surface of the leaves indicate the presence of
the rust beneath. This is the <i>Uredo betulina</i> of old
authors (begging their pardons, for some of them
still live), the <i>Lecythea longicapsula</i> of more recent
times, and the summer spores of <i>Melampsora betulina</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>according to M. Tulasne and his disciples. When
fresh, it is reputed to exhale a faint odour, as of the
primrose. During the winter and spring months
the wedge-like spores of the second crop are
matured on the fallen leaves (<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> figs. 189,
190), and these are capable of a speedy germination,
and the production of secondary reproductive
bodies, as in the willow rust above alluded to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably, also, the similar rust on the poplar
(<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> figs. 195, 196), or on the aspen, may be
met with under like conditions; <i>i.e.</i>, the summer
spores, which are yellow and spherical, on the living
leaves, and the brown permanent masses of winter
spores on the fallen and decaying leaves. The sole
remaining British species is not uncommon on
leaves of the common spurge in gardens, and
whilst the yellow pulverulent spores occur on the
upper, it will not be improbable that black permanent
spots will be found on the lower leaves
(<a href='#i112'>Plate IX.</a> figs. 193, 194), enclosing closely-packed,
rudimentary, elongated or wedge-shaped cellules of
the winter spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any one may make himself acquainted with the
genus <i>Coleosporium</i> with but little trouble, which
the acquisition will more than compensate. A
summer stroll into any locality in which the common
coltsfoot can be found, will be certain to prove
sufficient. Let the spot selected be any station on
the North Kent Railway, for those who reside in
town, or even a trip to the Crystal Palace and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>stroll in the grounds, and when the well-known
leaves of the coltsfoot are descried, the under surface
of the first leaf will doubtless give proof of the
presence of the fungus in question, by the orange
spores amongst its dense woolly hairs. Sometimes
the leaf is almost covered beneath with the bright
orange-coloured dust. This is the coltsfoot rust
(<i>Coleosporium tussilaginis</i>, Lev., <a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 180),
which may serve as a type of the rest. It may be
observed that a species of cluster-cup, or <i>Æcidium</i>,
with spores of nearly the same colour, is also to be
found on the leaves of the same plant; but in this
case the upper surface of the leaf has also corresponding
purplish spots, and, what is of still more
importance, the spores are seated in small fringed
cups. The rust is common till the wintry frosts have
set in, and is far more conspicuous than the cluster-cups.
A kind of di-morphism prevails in all the
species of this genus. Some of the pustules resolve
themselves into a kind of powder, whilst others
remain entire and solid. Generally there is the
largest proportion of globose, dust-like, free spores,
produced in the earliest developed fungi, whilst they
become more rare towards the close of the season.
The permanent spore-spots consist of obovate
cellules placed side by side, each of which is divided
transversely by three or four septa, and is filled with
an orange-red endochrome (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 181);
the exterior being enveloped in a kind of mucous
layer. The arrangement of spores when packed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>together in the pustule is shown in <a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a>
fig. 182, from an allied species. When these spores
germinate, which they do with great readiness, each
division emits a long tube, which generally remains
simple and undivided, and from its extremity is
produced a reproductive body of an obovate or
nearly kidney-shape. These filaments are about
1/120th of an inch in length, of a colourless transparent
membrane, along which the orange-red
contents of the spores pass into the newly-formed
sporidia, or reproductive bodies by which they are
terminated. Most of these reniform sporidia disengage
themselves from the filaments on which they
are produced, and either elongate themselves into
a simple and uniform filament, or swell at the
extremity as if to reproduce a second spore. If the
newly-formed sporidia do not become free, they
increase the length of their primitive filament,
which by a frequent repetition of the process
becomes a tube swelling out at unequal distances.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c023'>The summer spores, or pulverulent spores of the
first generation, which are analogous to the Uredospores
of <i>Aregma</i>, are also capable of germination,
for, if placed in favourable circumstances, they will
develop very long filiform processes, which either
remain simple or become more or less branched,
but always nearly uniform in their diameter. M.
Tulasne states that he has observed this germination
many times, though we have been less fortunate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Of the six species of this genus known to occur
in Great Britain, the majority may be commonly
met with. That very widely-diffused plant, the
wood cow-wheat (<i>Melampyrum pratense</i>), known
well to all amateur botanists for its pertinacity in
drying black, and presenting anything but an
inviting appearance to claim for it a place in the
herbarium—also becomes the matrix for the development
of a member of this genus; <i>i.e.</i>, the
cow-wheat rust (<i>Coleosporium Rhinanthacearum</i>,
Lev.), and which is found on other allied plants,
as the little eyebright (<i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>), &amp;c.
(<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 176). In colour and habit it
resembles the last-named species, and its free,
echinulate spores (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 177) form a
pretty object for the microscope.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another equally common species is found inhabiting
the leaves of the sow-thistles (<i>Sonchus arvensis</i>
and <i>S. oleraceus</i>), and in the autumn may generally
be found on either of those plants, presenting the
appearance delineated in our plate (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a>
fig. 178). The permanent spores resemble in many
points those of the first species, as will be seen
from the figure from De Bary’s treatise on this
subject (<a href='#i104'>Plate VIII.</a> fig. 179). This is certainly one
of the most showy of uredinous fungi, and could
not be well overlooked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The butter-bur rust (<i>Coleosporium petasites</i>, Lev.)
and the Campanula rust (<i>Coleosporium Campanulæ</i>,
Lev.) are found, the former on the leaves of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>butter-bur, and the latter on those of the harebell
and other <i>Campanulæ</i>, less frequently. We have,
however, indicated sufficient, since their great similarity
in unprofessional eyes will furnish, in one or
two species, all that is desirable for the microscopist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unless some similar plan to the following be
adopted for examining the species of this genus,
it may result in disappointment; for the slight
attachment of the joints to each other will otherwise
present only a mass of simple echinulate
cellules, if a portion be only removed from the leaf
on the point of a lancet. This method consists in
making a thin vertical section of a pustule in which
the spores are contained; by this means the arrangement
of the fruit and the mucedinous threads from
whence they proceed may be observed. Any person
possessed of the cardinal virtues of microscopy—patience
and perseverance—will be rewarded in
this instance; whilst those who are deficient will
lose an object worthy of the virtues they dare not
boast. But few instances have occurred in this and
the preceding chapters in which the exercise of any
great ingenuity or application has been called for;
the most juvenile or truest tyro at the microscope
may see for himself much of what has been
indicated, whilst a few opportunities have occurred
for more practised manipulists to prove that they
are neither juveniles nor tyros.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>ALLUSION has already been made to the important
memoir recently published by Dr. de
Bary. “White rusts” occupy a conspicuous position
in that memoir, and the experiments therein
detailed, with the conclusions arrived at, will be
largely drawn upon in furnishing the present chapter.
Whilst believing that we have fairly represented
the views, and faithfully narrated the story
of research, if not literally, but denuded of some
technicality, yet in such manner as to convey the
sense of our author, we claim no originality or
merit save for the garb in which it appears, without
addition, stricture, or confirmation of our own.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is the external appearance presented by
the “white rust” of cabbages, and allied cruciferous
plants, is soon told. During summer and
autumn it occupies the surface of the leaves and
stems of the shepherd’s-purse (<i>Capsella bursa-pastoris</i>),
with elongated narrow white spots like
streaks of whitewash (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 198), and later
in the season the leaves of cauliflowers and cabbages
become ornamented with similar patches,
arranged in a circular manner (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 199),
forming spots as large as a sixpence. Wherever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>these spots appear, the plant is more or less deformed,
swollen, or blistered, even before the parasite
makes its appearance at the surface. These
white pustules have a vegetative system of ramifying
threads which traverse the internal portion of
the plants on which they are found: these threads
constitute what is termed the <i>mycelium</i>. Not only
when the plant is deformed and swollen with its
undeveloped parasite do we meet with the threads
of mycelium in its internal structure, but also in
apparently healthy portions of the plant, far removed
from the evidently infected spots. These
threads are unequal in thickness, much branched,
and often with thick gelatinous walls filled with a
colourless fluid. They creep insidiously along the
intercellular passages, and are provided with certain
appendages in the form of straight thread-like
tubes, swollen at their tips into globular vesicles
(<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 204). These threads do not exceed
in length the diameter of the mycelium which bears
them. The appendages communicate in their interior
with the mycelium, and contain within them
the same fluid, which at length becomes more
watery, and the terminal vesicles have their walls
thickened, so as to resemble, on a casual observation,
granules of starch. Dr. de Bary conceives
that these appendages serve a similar purpose to
the tendrils or suckers of climbing phanerogamic
plants; <i>i.e.</i>, to fix the mycelium to the cells which
are to supply the parasite with nourishment. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>these appendages are always present, it is easy to
discover the mycelium wherever it exists amongst
the tissues of an affected plant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The white pustules already alluded to contain the
fruit of the parasite. Bundles of clavate or club-shaped
tubes are produced upon the mycelium beneath
the epidermis of the infested plant, forming
a little tuft or cushion, with each tube producing
at its apex reproductive cells, designated “conidia.”
These conidia appear to be produced in the following
manner:—The tips of the clavate tubes generate
them in succession. At first a septum, or
partition, divides from the lower portion of the
tube a conidium cell; this becomes constricted at
the septum and assumes a spherical shape, at
length only attached by a short narrow neck.
Beneath this again the same process is repeated
to form another and another conidium in succession,
until a bead-like string of conidia surmount each
of the tubes from which they are produced (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a>
fig. 200). At length the distended epidermis
above is no longer able to bear the pressure of the
mass of engendered conidia within, and is ruptured
irregularly, so that the conidia, easily separating
from each other at the narrow neck, make their
escape.</p>

<p class='c008'>As long since as 1807, M. Prevost described the
zoospores, or moving spores, of these conidia, and
his observations were confirmed by Dr. de Bary three
years since, and are now adverted to by him again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in further confirmation. If the conidia (white
spherical bodies ejected from the pustules of the
“white rust”) are sown in a drop of water on a
glass slide, being careful to immerse them entirely,
they will rapidly absorb the water and swell; soon
afterwards a large and obtuse papilla, resembling
the neck of a bottle, is produced at one of the
extremities. At first vacuoles are formed in the
contents of each conidium; as these disappear, the
whole protoplasm (granular substance filling the
conidium) becomes separated by very fine lines
of demarcation, into from five to eight polyhedric
portions, each with a faintly coloured vacuole in
the centre. These portions are so many <i>zoospores</i>.
Some minutes after the internal division, the papilla
swells and makes itself an opening, through which
the zoospores are expelled one by one, without
giving any signs of movement of their own. They
take a flat disk-like or lenticular form, and group
themselves about the opening, whence they have
been expelled, in a globular mass. Soon, however,
they begin to move, vibratile ciliæ show themselves,
and by means of these appendages the entire
globule oscillates, the zoospores disengage themselves
from each other, the mass is broken up,
and each zoospore swims off on its own account
(<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 208).</p>

<p class='c008'>The free zoospores are of the form of a planoconvex
lens, obtuse at the edge. Beneath the
plane face, out of the centre, and towards that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>point of the margin which during the movement
of the zoospore is foremost, is a disk-shaped
vacuole, with two ciliæ of unequal length attached
to its margin; the shorter cilia is directed forwards,
and the longer in the opposite direction, during the
evolutions of the zoospores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The zoospores are produced within from an hour
and a half to three hours after the sowing of the
conidia in water. They are never absent if the
conidia are fresh, or even a month old, but beyond
this period their artificial generation is very uncertain.
This little experiment is a very simple
and interesting one, and may be performed by any
one who will take the trouble to follow out these
instructions.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this simple experiment, let us turn for a
moment to the plant in its natural condition when
affected by the white rust. If, after rain or dew,
when the little drops of moisture hang like pearls
about the sickly pallid leaves of the shepherd’s-purse,
bespattered with the white pustules of the
rust, we collect and examine a drop of water from
the immediate neighbourhood of one of the pustules,
we shall commonly find empty conidia and zoospores
in different stages of development.</p>
<div id='i128'  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/i128.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Plate XI.<br />W. West imp.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c023'>Water alone seems to be essential to them, and
for this the conidia may remain unchanged for a
month, and literally burst into activity at the first
gentle shower, till the whole surface of the plant is
swarming with zoospores. We may no longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>doubt that a true vegetable produces from itself
bodies endowed with active motion, resembling low
forms of animal life, and yet in themselves not
animalcules, as some would suggest, but essentially
vegetable, as we shall hereafter demonstrate. To
scientific men this is not new, except as regards
fungi, for in algæ such bodies have long been
recognized.</p>

<p class='c008'>A second kind of reproductive organs are described
by Dr. de Bary; and if future examinations
confirm his observations, as they doubtless will,
this feature is an important one. It is true that
M. Caspary long since detected similar bodies in
moulds (allied to that which produces the potato
disease), but he only knew <i>them</i> in a limited sense
compared with what De Bary has revealed. These
fruits are hidden amid the tissues of the plant on
which the “white rust” is parasitic, and only
betray their presence by the coloration of those
tissues. To these bodies it is proposed to give the
name of “oogonia” and “antheridia,” on account
of their presumed sexuality, the “oogonia” representing
the female, and the “antheridia” the male
organs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oogonia are large spherical or ovoid cells,
with a thickish membrane containing a granular
protoplasm, or formative fluid. They are produced
either terminally or laterally upon the threads of
the mycelium, from which they are separated by
septa or partitions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The antheridia are somewhat blunt-shaped or
obovate cellules, considerably smaller than the
oogonia, with slightly thickened walls, and containing
a finely granular protoplasm. These are
produced upon branches of the mycelium which
do not bear oogonia. The obtuse extremities of
these branches, which are to be developed as
antheridia, are applied to the surface of the growing
oogonia, to which they adhere, become distended,
assume their obovate form, and by the
formation of a septum at their base, their contents
are isolated from those of the threads of the
mycelium, and thus the antheridia are perfected.</p>

<p class='c008'>When these bodies have attained their full
dimensions, the large granules which are contained
in the oogonium accumulate at its centre, and form
an irregular, somewhat spherical mass, which is
called by De Bary a <i>gonosphere</i>. This gonosphere
having been formed, a straight tube shoots out
from the antheridium which perforates the wall
of the oogonium, passes through the fluid which
surrounds the gonosphere, elongating itself until
it touches that body. From this period a membrane
begins to be formed about the gonosphere,
which thenceforth maintains a regular spheroidal
form. It may be observed that the extremity of the
tube which proceeds from the antheridium does not
open, and the fecundation, if such it be, is produced
solely by contact. After this contact of the
two bodies, the gonosphere acquires a new name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>and is called an “oospore.” The membrane which
at first invests this organ is very thin, but by
deposits from the surrounding fluid it attains to
a greater thickness, and is at length of a yellowish-brown
colour, having its surface studded with large
obtuse warts (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 206). One of these
warts, larger than the rest, forms a kind of thick
sheath around the fecundating tube.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oospores do not give evidence of any appreciable
change for some months. For instance,
those collected by De Bary in June did not attain
their ulterior development until the commencement
of December. The method adopted was as follows:—Parts
of the plants containing ripe oospores
were preserved in the dried state. When examination
was considered desirable, the portion to be
employed was immersed in water for a day or two;
it was then placed on a humid soil, or mould
covered with blotting-paper. The tissues enclosing
the oospores were decomposed, and at the end of
from four to eight days their germination might
be observed when placed in a drop of water. This
method again corresponds with the ordinary processes
by which the plant naturally decays on
exposure to the influences of the atmosphere, and
the oospores germinate under the favour of a
shower of rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the oospore, after the decay of the tissues,
is isolated and placed in a drop of water, the
brown investing membrane will be seen to rupture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>irregularly, and its contents (enclosed in a transparent
inner membrane) issuing from the orifice.
As in the case of the conidia, this body at first
contains vacuoles, and is afterwards divided into
polyhedric portions; these pass into zoospores,
which congregate at the centre into a globular
mass (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 207). They afterwards separate,
and for some minutes float about in the vesicle in
which they were generated. Ultimately the membrane
ruptures, and the zoospores swim about in
water just as those produced from the conidia had
done. The number contained in each oospore is
considerable, and may be estimated at not less than
one hundred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The zoospores, whether produced from conidia
or from oospores, appear to be the same. The
movements of both in the water last from two to
three hours; then they cease, the ciliæ disappear,
and the zoospores remain at rest, taking meanwhile
a globular form. Afterwards these spores (for
having ceased all motion they are no longer zoospores)
emit a thin tube from some portion of their
surface, such tube attaining a length of from two
to ten times that of the spore whence it proceeds.
The extremity of these tubes swells and
forms a kind of cell, into which the contents of
the spore pass through the medium of the tube
(<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 209).</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus far, and thus far only, has Dr. de Bary
been enabled to trace the development of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>zoospores in a drop of water. Another series of
experiments was instituted by this mycologist
having especial reference to the parasitism of the
“white rust.” He made numerous observations to
ascertain whether the spores, or the germinating
tubes, entered by the roots of growing plants, and
satisfied himself that they did not. Plants of
garden-cress, mustard, and shepherd’s-purse had
their roots immersed in water impregnated with
zoospores. After one or two days, though the surfaces
of the roots were covered with zoospores that
had emitted their germinating tubes in all directions,
none had penetrated or showed the least tendency
to penetrate the epidermis. Other plants were
planted in flowerpots and watered at the roots with
water charged with zoospores, and for two days the
pots were left standing in the water similarly
charged, then the plants were removed, cultivated
in the ordinary manner, grew up healthy, and gave
no signs of the white rust. Care had been taken
that neither stems nor leaves should come in contact
with water containing zoospores.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a drop of water thus charged is placed on the
surface of a living leaf of the shepherd’s-purse, for
instance, and left at rest for a few hours and examined
minutely at the end of that period, they
will be found to have germinated. Let the epidermis
be removed carefully and placed on a glass
slide and submitted to the microscope. Many
zoospores will be found to have produced from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>point of their surface which is nearest to one of the
stomata, or pores of the leaf, its slender tube, and
to have thrust it through those openings, with the
swollen extremity resting in the air-cavity situated
beneath the pore. If many days, or even weeks,
are allowed to pass, and the leaf is examined again,
or another leaf similarly treated, and kept in a
living and vigorous condition by remaining attached
to the parent plant, still no further change or
advance will be observed, the germs will appear
fresh, and still in the same condition. Hence it is
concluded that plants are not infected through the
medium of their leaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the cotyledons, or seed-leaves, are watered
with similar impregnated water, a different result
has been observed to take place. The germination
of the tubes till their entrance at the stomata is the
same; but, having entered, the swollen extremity
elongates, becomes branched, and takes all the
appearance of mycelium such as we at first
described. If the infected plant endures through
the winter, the mycelium endures with it, to recommence
vegetating in the spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experiments which Dr. de Bary performed
were all upon plants of the common garden-cress.
It will be unnecessary to repeat all the details of
these, as given in the memoir recently published on
the subject, but it will suffice to give a summary of
results. In two series of plants cultivated at different
periods from good seeds, one hundred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>five plants which, had not received the water
impregnated with zoospores upon their cotyledons
vegetated without any indications of the parasite.
Amongst the eighteen plants which were inoculated
by watering the cotyledons, four only were not
attacked by the parasite, fourteen bore the “white
rust.” In six of these it did not extend beyond
the cotyledons; in the others it also appeared on
the stems and leaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>From these experiments it may be deduced that
plants are not infected by spores of the parasite
entering at the roots, or by their leaves, but that
inoculation takes place through the medium of the
cotyledons, or seed-leaves; that the agents in this
inoculation are the zoospores produced either from
the conidia or the oospores; that they do not enter
the stomata or pores themselves, but thrust out a
germinating tube, into the extremity of which the
contents of the zoospores pass; that when these
tubes have entered the stomata of the cotyledons
they branch and ramify, becoming a true mycelium,
from which fruitful parasites are developed; that
if a plant so infested lives through the winter, the
parasite lives with it, to vegetate again in the
spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The immense number of zoospores capable of
being produced from a single infested plant is
almost beyond calculation. It is easy for a million
of conidia to be developed from such a plant, each
producing from five to eight zoospores, besides a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>large number of oospores, each containing a hundred
zoospores. It can scarcely be considered
marvellous that the white rust should be so common
on plants favourable to its development, the
marvel being rather that any plant should escape.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c023'>Until recently it was doubtful whether more than
one or two species of <i>Cystopus</i> (white rust) were
known. It is now certain that we have three in
Great Britain, and three or four others are found
elsewhere. Of the British species one is found on
many cruciferous plants, as the shepherd’s-purse,
garden-cress, mustard, radish, and plants of the
cabbage kind. This is the <i>Cystopus candidus</i>.
Another occurs on the goat’s-beard, salsify, and
scorzonera, which is called <i>Cystopus cubicus</i>. Both
have great external resemblances, but both possess
specific internal differences. In the Goat’s-beard
rust (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 201) the terminal conidia in the
bunches or fascicles of conidia which are produced
within the pustules are spheroidal, large, and of a
yellow-brown tint, whilst the residue are cylindrical,
smaller (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 202), and more or less compressed.
In the crucifer rust the conidia are all
equal in the pustules and globose. The oospores
in the former of these are subglobose and the warts
on their surface are solid; whilst in the latter the
oospores are truly globose, and the warts on the
surface are hollow (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 210). The third
species is the Sandspurry white rust (<i>Cystopus
Lepigoni</i>), which was found on the common sandspurry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>(<i>Spergularia rubra</i>) by Mr. R. G. Keeley, in
Swanscombe Marshes (September, 1864). Of the
other species it is not improbable that one or two
may yet be found in this country. Without attempting
to indicate their microscopic differences,
it may be serviceable to name the species of
phanerogamic plants on which they are likely to
be found. The Purslane white rust (<i>Cystopus Portulacæ</i>,
D. C.) should be sought on the purslane,
which, though of limited cultivation, is exceedingly
liable to attack from this parasite, and the Thistle
white rust (<i>Cystopus spinulosus</i>, D. By.) may probably
be met with on the leaves of the common
thistle (<i>Cnicus arvensis</i>) or some of its allies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considerable interest is now attached to these
parasites, which, as far as we at present know,
differ materially in their reproduction from the
other dust-like or uredinous fungi with which they
have long been associated. Dr. de Bary proposes
the union of these with the mould-like fungi of the
genus <i>Peronospora</i>, to which the mould infesting
the potato belongs, so as to constitute by themselves
a group apart from the genera with which
both have heretofore been associated. Whether
his views will be accepted by mycologists time will
speedily prove. Under any circumstances, microscopical
and botanical science will reap considerable
benefit from his researches.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>TWENTY years since, and some of these little
pests were altogether unknown, whilst others
were only recognized and partly understood by a
few scientific men. During the period to which
we have alluded more than half the present species
contained in the genus <i>Peronospora</i> had never been
observed, and amongst these the most devastating
of its tribe, the associate and undoubted cause of
the potato disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Parasitic fungi are far more numerous, both in
individuals and species, than most persons are
aware, and cultivated plants of all kinds are more
or less subject to their ravages. Some are more
susceptible than others, of which the corn and
grass tribe, or <i>Graminaceæ</i>, as they are termed
by botanists, is an example. Not less than thirty
species have been recorded upon plants of this
natural order, and of these nearly one-half are
found upon the living plants. Upon the potato
plant, again, no less than ten different kinds of
fungi have been described; whilst upon other and
more fortunate plants only one or two parasites of
this nature establish themselves.</p>

<p class='c023'>It will be sufficient for our present purpose to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>state that one of the six families into which fungi
are divided for scientific purposes is called <i>Hyphomycetes</i>,
a name compounded of two Greek words
signifying “thread” and “mould,” or “fungus,”
and is applied to this group because the thread-like
filaments of which they are largely composed
are the most prominent feature. In this family
there are again a number of smaller groups called
orders, having an equal value to the natural orders
of flowering plants; and one of these orders, called
<i>Mucedines</i>, has the fertile threads perfectly distinct
from the mycelium or spawn. These threads are
sometimes simple and sometimes branched; they
may be articulated or without articulations or septa,
short or long, erect or creeping, hyaline or whitish,
mostly free from colour, and are not coated with
a distinct membrane. The spores are generally
simple, sometimes solitary, at others in pairs, or
strung together like beads for a necklace. Amongst
all this variety of arrangement there is order, for
these are but features, or partly the features, of the
different genera of which the <i>Mucedines</i> are composed.
One of the genera is termed <i>Peronospora</i>,
and to this the parasitic fungus of the potato, and
some others to which we shall have occasion to
refer, belong. In this genus the threads are
generally branched, but without articulations. The
spores, or seed-like bodies, are of two kinds; one
kind is borne on the tips of the branches; and the
other kind, which is larger and globose, is borne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>upon the creeping mycelium or spawn. All the
members of this genus with which we are acquainted
are parasitic on living plants, inducing in them
speedy decay, but preceding that decay of which
they are themselves the cause. Hence we have
deemed it the more advantageous course both for
writer and reader to associate together the different
species of this particular genus of parasitic moulds
in one chapter, rather than bring together the
different kinds of fungi, belonging perhaps to
widely separated genera, but all associated with,
or parasitic upon, the same plant. The botanical
student will thank us for following this plan, and
the general reader will labour under no disadvantage,
in this instance at least, from the similarity
of the diseases produced in the plants infested.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been recently proposed to associate the
genera <i>Peronospora</i> and <i>Cystopus</i> together in one
group, under the name of <i>Peronosporei</i>; but with
the discussion of this subject we have nothing
to do in this volume. Having announced this fact,
we shall continue to notice them in the several
positions heretofore accorded to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mycelium (root-like fibres) in this genus
greatly resembles that described for the “white
rusts,” though neither so thick, nor is the membrane
so gelatinous as in that genus. In some
instances the mycelium is confined to the inter-cellulary
passages; but in most cases they also
perforate the cells of the plant which nourishes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>them. The sucker-like bodies already described in
<i>Cystopus</i> are often found produced on the mycelium
of <i>Peronospora</i>, but occasionally they appear to be
absent, especially in the mould causing the potato
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the mycelium erect threads are produced,
upon which one form of fruit, which may be
termed “acrospores,” is borne. These filaments are
sometimes single, and sometimes in small tufts or
fascicles. In some instances they are considerably
branched, so as to present a dendroidal or tree-like
appearance; in others they are nearly simple, being
only surmounted by short spicules; or, in one
instance, quite simple, and only surmounted by a
single acrospore. The branching habit is by far
the most common.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each ultimate branch in the ramification of the
fertile filaments engenders a single acrospore. Its
extremity, at first thin and pointed, swells in the
form of a globular vesicle, which soon takes the
elliptical or ovate shape of the perfected acrospore,
and at length separates itself from the branch that
supports it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all instances the acrospores have a similar
structure, but with minute differences in form, &amp;c.,
which have their importance in the determination
of species. In most cases the apex of the acrospore
is obtuse, and the entire body has a violet tint,
more or less deep; in some it is completely colourless.
These acrospores, when placed in favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>conditions, will germinate, and, in fact, comport
themselves in the manner of true spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the year 1861, Dr. de Bary published an
account<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> of the discovery by him of zoospores,
similar to those already described in connection
with the conidia of the “white rusts,” produced
from the acrospores of the mould which originates
the potato disease. In the same author’s memoir
of 1864, already quoted, the observations there
made are confirmed. When the acrospores of the
potato mould and the parsnip mould are sown in
water upon a glass slide, their contents become
divided, and vacuoles are formed, as already described
in <i>Cystopus</i>; these parts are expelled through
an apical orifice, and, when free, take the form
of perfect zoospores, and commence swimming
about in the fluid surrounding them.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f8'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Die gegenwartig herrschende Kartoffelkrankheit, ihre
Ursache und ihre Verhütung. Von Dr. A. de Bary. Leipsig:
1861.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>These zoospores are oval, or semi-oval, with a
structure resembling that of the “white rusts,”
save that the two ciliæ, or vibratile hairs, proceed
from the same point. The number of zoospores
from each acrospore of the potato mould is stated
to be from six to sixteen, and in the parsnip mould
from six to fourteen. Their ultimate development
is the same as has already been described. In
the potato mould, the production of the zoospores
is much favoured by the exclusion of light.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Another mode of germination in the acrospores
of the potato mould has been observed by the same
eminent mycologist. This results when the spores
are sown upon a humid body, or on the <i>surface</i>
of a drop of water. The acrospore emits from its
summit a simple tube, the extremity of which
swells into an oval vesicle; into this the contents
pass, and it isolates itself by a partition from the
germ-tube. Thus it becomes a duplicate of the
acrospore from whence it was derived. This
secondary body has also the power of producing a
tertiary cellule in a similar manner. Both the
second and third cellule, when <i>immersed</i> in water,
produce zoospores in the ordinary manner, as above
described.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet another and a third mode of germination
is described by the same author, in which the
acrospore emits from its apex a germ-tube, which
elongates considerably; and into this long and
tortuous tube the contents of the acrospore pass,
and accumulate at the opposite extremity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The germ-tubes, produced in the manner last
described, when developed on the surface of a
favourable plant, perforate the cells of the epidermis,
or enter by the stomata. In the case of the potato
mould, the germ-tubes enter by the stomata; but
in the majority of species the germ-tubes do not
enter by the natural pores of the leaves upon which
the acrospores are sown, but perforate the cellules,
and thus effect admission into the tissues of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>plant, where they extend, ramify themselves, and
become a mycelium. This mycelium originates
branched threads, bearing acrospores at the tips
of their branchlets, and in many species of <i>Peronospora</i>
another kind of reproductive body upon the
threads of the mycelium itself. To these bodies we
must briefly address ourselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>This last kind of reproductive organs (not yet
positively found in the potato mould) appear to be
wholly analogous to the oogonia of the “white
rusts” already described, producing oospores in
like manner. Dr. de Bary avows with regret that
his numerous efforts to observe the germination of
these oospores were unsuccessful. Nevertheless,
he considers that the perfect resemblance between
them and the oospores of the “white rusts” will
justify him in concluding that the germination in
both is very similar. It will be unnecessary to
repeat here the observations already made on the
growth and development of oogones and zoospores.
What has been advanced respecting these organs
in <i>Cystopus</i> will apply also to <i>Peronospora</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Potato Mould.</span>—Towards the close of the summer
of 1845, in the course of a few weeks, every
one became aware of the fact that a new disease
had appeared which threatened the entire destruction
of the potato crop. Until then it seemed to
have been almost, although not entirely unknown.
It first appeared in the Isle of Wight about the
middle of August, and a week afterwards had become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>general in the South of England, and the
next week there were but few sound samples of
potatoes in the London market. Early in September
the disease had commenced its ravages in
Ireland, and shortly afterwards it was discovered in
Scotland. With the same rapidity it seems to have
spread throughout Europe and North America, or
at least the western portion of the former and the
northern districts of the latter. It must not be
imagined, however, that the Isle of Wight was the
centre from which this disease spread over such an
extended area and with such alarming rapidity.
From this spot it doubtless made its first appearance
that year amongst our own crops, but there
is not the least doubt of its existence both on the
continent of Europe and in North America in the
previous year, and the farmers of Belgium had
noted its appearance in the province of Liège as
far back as 1842 and 1843. Other diseases had
been observed affecting the potato crop before, and
one which was also associated with a parasitic
fungus had made its appearance in 1815. It is
also exceedingly probable that, in a milder form,
the murrain was present with us a year or two
before it broke out to such an alarming extent.
A correspondent to the <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i>, in
1844, notices it in the Isle of Thanet, and another
testifies to its occurrence in districts of Ireland for
two or three years previous to its general outbreak.
The description of the disease in Canada, in 1844,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>contained in a letter addressed to Dr. Bellingham,
and quoted by the Rev. M. J. Berkeley,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a> leaves no
doubt of its identity:—“During the months of
July and August (1844), we had repeated and
heavy showers, with oppressive heat, and an atmosphere
strongly charged with electricity. Towards
the close of the month of August I observed
the leaves to be marked with black spots, as if ink
had been sprinkled over them. They began to
wither, emitting a peculiar, offensive odour; and
before a fortnight the field, which had been singularly
luxuriant, and almost rank, became arid and
dried up, as if by a severe frost. I had the potatoes
dug out during the month of September, when
about two-thirds were either positively rotten, partially
decayed and swarming with worms, or spotted
with brownish-coloured patches, resembling flesh
that had been frost-bitten. These parts were soft
to the touch, and upon the decayed potatoes I
observed a whitish substance like mould.”</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f9'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Journal of Horticultural Society of London, vol. i. p. 11.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Although this disease made its first appearance,
in the middle of August, 1845, in the Isle of Wight,
it had already appeared in Belgium in the same
year, a month previously; and although it may
have been noticed in other British localities in
1844, it was known in Canada and in St. Helena in
the same year to a far greater extent, and in Liège
as early as 1842. There are, therefore, good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>grounds for believing that the European centre was
Belgium; but if M. Boussingault was correct in
stating that “this malady is well known in rainy
years at Bogota, where the Indians live almost
entirely on potatoes,” then it is not of European
but American origin, and is probably derived from
districts not far remote from those whence Europe
first received the potato itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would occupy too much space to detail the
different theories and opinions relative to the causes
of this disease to which 1845 and subsequent years
gave birth. Suffice it to say, that the lapse of
years has silently proved the majority of these to
have been fallacious. All such as imputed to peculiar
electric conditions, a wet season, or other
meteorological influences, the disease which has
re-appeared under different conditions and influences,
and in seasons remarkable for dryness,
are manifestly refuted; whilst its mycological
origin has continued to gain adherents, and the
gradual accumulation of fresh facts has almost
placed it beyond dispute not only that the potato
disease is accompanied by, but results from, fungal
growth. Unfortunately, this disease has been so
prevalent, more or less, during the past eighteen
years, that few have been without the opportunity
of making themselves acquainted with its external
appearance. To this may be added the minute
and exact account of its development, as recorded
by that excellent mycologist and careful observer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, in 1846, and to which,
even now, nothing of importance can be supplemented
or abstracted:—“The leaves began suddenly
to assume a paler, and at length a yellowish
tint, exhibiting here and there discoloured spots.
More or less coinciding with these spots, on the
reverse of the leaves, appeared white mealy patches,
consisting of a minute mould, proceeding, either
singly or in fascicles, from the stomata, and arising
from an abundant branched mycelium creeping in
every direction through the loose tissue beneath
the cuticle. The upper surface rarely, if ever,
exhibits the mould, it being almost physically impossible
for its delicate threads to penetrate the
closely-packed cells which, being arranged side by
side, leave scarcely any intercellular passages. The
mould, in a few hours from its first piercing the
apertures of the stomata, perfects its fruit, and in
so doing completely exhausts the matrix, which in
consequence withers. No sooner have a number
of the leaves been attacked, than the stem itself is
subject to change, becoming spotted here and there
with dark brown patches, in which the cells are
mostly filled with a dark grumous mass, without
exhibiting any mucedinous filaments; though, occasionally,
I have ascertained their presence. Very
rarely fructifying but dwarfed specimens of the
mould occur upon it. The stem now rapidly putrefies,
the cuticle and its subjacent tissue become
pulpy, and separate when touched from the woody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>parts beneath. The whole soon dries up, and in
many instances exhibits in the centre the black,
irregular fungoid masses which are known under
the name of <i>Sclerotium varium</i>, and which are
believed to be the mycelium of certain moulds in
a high state of condensation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the tubers are now examined, the greater part
will often be found smaller than usual, especially
if the disease has commenced at an early stage of
growth; but in their natural condition, while here
and there a tuber, particularly if it has been
partially exposed, exhibits traces of disease. The
surface is, however, soon marked with livid patches,
commencing generally about the eyes, or at the
point of connection with the fructifying shoots:
these rapidly acquire a spotted appearance, the
spots being rather waved, and assuming often a
more or less concentric arrangement. Sometimes—especially
on the smoother kinds of tuber—two or
more regular systems of concentric spots are exhibited
on the same tuber. The skin now withers,
and is easily separated; the spots become depressed
and of a yellowish tinge; and if the tubers be laid
in a moist place, in a day or two—sometimes in a
few hours—the same mould which destroyed the
leaves springs from them, piercing the cuticle from
within, yet not scattered, as on the leaves, but
forming a conspicuous white tuft. If a section of
the diseased tuber be made on the first symptoms
of the disease, little brownish or rusty specks are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>found in the cellular tissue, confined, with very rare
exceptions, to the space between the cuticle and
the sac, if I may so call it, of spiral vessels and
their accompanying tissue, which, springing from
the subterranean branches, pass into the tuber,
making their way to the several buds disposed on
the surface. These spots consist at first of a quantity
of discoloured cells, mixed more or less with
others in a healthy condition. The grains of fecula
are for a long time perfectly healthy; the cells
themselves, so far from being looser, are more
closely bound together than in the more healthy
portions. The rusty spots soon exhibit a darker
tint, spreading in every direction and becoming
confluent; they at length extend beyond the barrier
of vascular tissue, and attack the central mass.
The tuber, meanwhile, assumes a disagreeable smell,
decomposes more or less rapidly, other Fungi establish
themselves on the surface, or in the decaying
mass, which emits a highly fetid odour, resembling
that of decaying agarics; the union of the cells is
dissolved, animalcules or mites make their appearance,
till at last the whole becomes a loathsome
mass of putrescence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The form of the mould itself is represented
(fig. 264) as exhibited under the microscope, with
the nodose swellings of the branches, and spores
attached to the tips. These acrospores are filled
with a granular mass, from which, as hereafter
described, zoospores are produced. The branching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>dendroidal threads of this fungus proceed from a
creeping mycelium or spawn of entangled filaments
which interpenetrates the matrix, upon
which it establishes itself. Upon these threads
spherical bodies were long since observed by Dr.
Payen, and, under the name of <i>Artotrogus</i>, described
by Dr. Montagne as a new species of fungus. Dr.
de Bary failed to detect oospores on the mycelium
of this mould, although the organs found by Payen
in some sort resemble them. De Bary sought in
vain, also, for the spherical bodies described by
the author above named. It has been calculated
that one square line of the under surface of the
leaves is capable of producing 3,270 acrospores,
each of which yields at least six zoospores, sometimes
double that number; thus we have 19,620
reproductive bodies from that small space. The
mycelium from the zoospores is capable of penetrating
the cellular tissue in twelve hours, and,
when established there, it bursts through the
stomata of the leaves, and fruit is perfected in
from fifteen to eighteen hours. Since the zoospores
are perfected and ready to germinate in twenty-four
hours from their being placed in water, it
becomes almost impossible to calculate the myriads
of fungi that may be produced from a single centre.
Dr. de Bary has also demonstrated that the brown
spots so characteristic of the disease are the result
of the action of the spores or zoospores. By
placing a quantity of spores in a drop of water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>on the leaves, stems, and tubers under a glass
sufficiently air-tight to prevent evaporation, he produced
the brown spots, and traced their progress
from the earliest stages.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are a few practical conclusions which may
be drawn from these discoveries. In the first
place, it is clearly shown by the production of the
spots that the fungus is capable of <i>causing</i> the
disease, a fact which has been disputed, but now
placed beyond doubt. The inference is, that not
only is it capable of producing, but is really the
cause of the potato murrain. With bodies so
minute and active as the zoospores, there can no
longer be difficulty in accounting for their penetrating
the tissues of the plant. They are most
active and productive in wet weather, especially
when it is also warm. Moisture appears to be
essential, and a dry season the greatest enemy to
the spread of the disease. That bodies so minute
and subtle should have baffled all efforts to destroy
or eradicate, is not now surprising. Whether any
method will be found to contend successfully with
it, is now more doubtful than ever. A careful
reperusal of the old facts by the aid of this new
light will tend to the elucidation of much of the
mystery in which the subject has been involved.
All who have hitherto been sceptical of the mycological
source of one of the greatest pests of modern
times should study M. de Bary’s pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c023'>The potato mould has been judiciously named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span><i>Peronospora infestans</i>, or, as it was at first called,
<i>Botrytis infestans</i>; but on a revision of the genera
<i>Botrytis</i> and <i>Peronospora</i>, it was transferred to the
latter genus, in which it remains. Three names were
given to it, within a short period of each other,
by different mycologists, in ignorance of its having
already received a name. The one we have adopted
appears to have the priority, at least of publication,
and was given by Dr. Montagne. That of <i>Botrytis
devastatrix</i> was given by Madame Libert, and
<i>Botrytis fallax</i> by M. Desmazières. The principal
feature in this species seems to consist in the
branches becoming alternately thickened and constricted,
so as to resemble a moniliform string or
necklace of little bladders or vesicles. The branches
are also more erect than in the allied species, and
the spores are solitary on the tips or from the sides
of the branches, and not in pairs or clusters, and
the tips are simple, and not bifid or trifid, as in
most of its allies. It need scarcely be remarked,
that a high power of the microscope is necessary
to make out the distinctive features of the different
members of this genus, and that to the naked eye
they only appear as a minute whitish mould. As
already stated, this little fungus makes its first
appearance on the under surface of the leaves,
especially the lower ones, of the potato plant, and
afterwards attacks the stem, and ultimately the
tuber. For examination it is better to select the
leaves soon after the fungus makes its appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span><span class='sc'>Turnip Mould.</span>—Since the advent of the potato
murrain a similar disease has been witnessed,
though more limited in its extent, amongst
Swedish turnips, commencing in little waved
irregular lines following the course of the vessels,
around which spots are formed by the deposition
of dark granules in the same manner as in the
potato. In this instance, the leaves apparently are
first attacked in a similar manner by a species of
mould or <i>Peronospora</i> allied to the one already
described, but which has been long known as
parasitic upon cruciferous plants, to which the
turnip belongs. This species, termed <i>Peronospora
parasitica</i>, is white in all stages of its growth. It
is much more branched, and the branches are comparatively
shorter than in the potato mould, and
the tips of the branches are bifid (fig. 262). The
acrospores are very large and globose, features
also which distinguish this mould from the last. A
short time since we were called to witness a bed of
splendid cauliflowers, which had, up to that time,
been the pride of their cultivator; but, alas! their
glory was threatened with speedy annihilation, for
in nearly every instance the lower leaves had
become more or less covered on their upper surface
with yellow spots, and beneath glaucous with the
mould we have been describing. The diseased
leaves were all immediately removed, but we fear
without success, although no positive information
has since reached us. The almost unnatural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>vigorous green of the leaves, prior to the appearance
of the mould, is not at all an uncommon
occurrence: this phenomenon has been noticed in
the ears of corn, in which every grain was soon
afterwards filled with spores of bunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>This species was at one time believed to be parasitic
on the “white rust,” from which circumstance
its specific name was derived. More precise examination
proves that it sometimes occurs where no
white rust is present, and therefore its parasitism is
imaginary. The suckers in this species are large
and penetrate the cells, often entirely filling them.
This feature is sufficient to distinguish the mycelium
of the mould from that of the “rust.” The turnip
mould occurs on many cruciferous plants, and
especially on the shepherd’s-purse, as well as upon
the different varieties of cabbage and its more
immediate allies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Onion Mould.</span>—Another disease, produced by
fungi of the same genus, makes its appearance
upon young onion plants in the spring. The mould
is called <i>Peronospora Schleideniana</i>, and has many
features in common with those already described.
In this instance the threads are greyish and erect,
with alternate branches, not divided by transverse
septa, and the spores are obovate, attenuated
towards their base (fig. 263). This mould, in some
years, is very common and destructive, by preventing
the young plants which are attacked from
coming to perfection. It is not confined to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>onion, but appears on other allied species of <i>Allium</i>
(to which the onion belongs). The threads form
large patches or blotches on the leaves, and sometimes
cover them entirely. It very much resembles
the turnip mould, from which the form of the spores
considerably differs. This is the same species as
that described by Caspary, and afterwards by
Berkeley, under the name of <i>P. destructor</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Lettuce Mould.</i>—A very similar mould (<i>Peronospora
gangliformis</i>) is sometimes very common in
spring on the under surface of the leaves of the cultivated
lettuce, appearing in definite white mouldy
spots. By reference to the figure of a portion of a
thread magnified (fig. 265), it will be seen that the
peculiar form of the tips of the branchlets evidences
the distinctness of this species.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oospores are small, globose, and of a yellowish-tawny
colour. This mould is by no means confined
to lettuces, but has also been found on species of
ragwort, sow-thistle, nipplewort, endive, and other
composite plants; and has from time to time
received numerous names, which it is unnecessary
to enumerate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Tare Mould.</span>—The under surface of the leaves of
tares, and sometimes also of peas, is liable to attack
from an allied species of mould (<i>Peronospora
Viciæ</i>). In the spring of 1846 it appeared amongst
vetches in some districts to such an extent as at
one time to threaten the destruction of the crops;
but a succession of dry weather at once abridged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>its power and limited its mischief. Mouldy vetches
and mouldy peas are, especially in moist seasons,
evils to which the agriculturist knows his crops to
be subject; he may not know, however, that this
kind of mould (fig. <a href='#i152a'>266</a>) is of so near a kin to that
which has acquired such wide-spread fame in connection
with the potato. Another species of fungus
attacks the garden pea in damp seasons, forming
small depressed brownish spots on the leaves and
pods; but this is quite distinct from the mould,
though probably not less injurious.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fertile threads are produced in dense clusters,
each many times branched, and bearing elliptic
acrospores obtuse at their apices, and of a violaceous
tint (fig. <a href='#i152a'>266</a>). The oospores are beautifully reticulated
and of a yellowish-brown colour (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a>
fig. 212).</p>

<p class='c008'>Trefoil and some other allied plants are attacked
by another species, characterized by Dr. de Bary as
<i>Peronospora trifoliorum</i>, which we have found rather
plentifully in some localities on lucern.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Parsnip Mould</span> (<i>Peronospora nivea</i>, Ung.)
is found on many umbelliferous plants; but its
attacks upon the parsnip are most to be deplored,
because it injures and ultimately destroys an article
of human food. The plants infested with this
parasite are first attacked in the leaves, but afterwards
the roots become spotted and diseased in a
similar manner to the potatoes attacked by its
congener. The disease has not hitherto been so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>general with the former as the latter; but in some
districts it has been far from uncommon.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fertile threads are collected in bundles, erect,
and not so much branched as in many other species.
The acrospores are subglobose or ovoid, and
papillate at their apices. This species is sometimes
called <i>P. umbelliferarum</i>, and sometimes <i>P. macrospora</i>.
Generally speaking the average humidity
of a season but little affects the production of
parasitic fungi. In a dry season, like that of 1864,
we found as many species, and these as flourishing
and numerous in individuals, as in a proverbially
wet year. Such is not the case, however, with the
moulds under notice, or such fungi as are reproduced
through the medium of zoospores: these are
undoubtedly less common in a very dry season;
but it must be remembered that a single shower is
sufficient for the development of zoospores, and
occasional showers or heavy dews will speed them
on their course of destruction as readily almost as
continuous moisture. The large fungi, on the
contrary, become very limited in numbers when the
weather is unusually dry.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Spinach Mould.</span>—Spinach is likewise liable to
suffer from the establishment of a mould upon the
under surface of the leaves: unfortunately this is
not unfrequent, and has been known in England
certainly for the last fifty or sixty years, since it
was figured by Sowerby in his “British Fungi”
as many years since. We have lately seen a bed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of spinach, utterly destroyed by this fungus; whilst
on another, not twenty yards apart, not a spotted
leaf could be found. This mould is the <i>Peronospora
effusa</i> of botanists; it occurs also on some species
of goosefoot (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig. 215), and probably on
knotgrass. To the naked eye it appears in pale
purplish-grey patches, which, when examined microscopically,
are found to consist of dense bundles
of branched threads, bearing ellipsoid acrospores,
the membranes of which have a violaceous tint.
The oogonia produced upon the mycelium vary
considerably in size. The oospores are of the
character delineated in our plate (<a href='#i120'>Plate X.</a> fig.
214).</p>

<p class='c008'>Hitherto all the species of mould to which we
have had occasion to refer have been found infesting
plants more or less employed as food; but
there remain one or two other species to which
we must make special reference. One of these
affects the most universal of favourites amongst
flowers: this is the rose mould. Attention was
directed to this mould, and it was described for the
first time under the name of <i>Peronospora sparsa</i>,
in the columns of the <i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i>, in 1862.
It occurred on a quantity of potted rose-plants in a
conservatory. Irregular pale brownish discoloured
spots appeared on the upper surface of the leaves;
these extended rapidly, and in a short time the leaves
withered and shrivelled up, and ultimately the
whole plant perished. A delicate greyish mould
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>was to be seen by the aid of a lens, scattered over
the under surface of the leaves. By the microscope,
the branched threads, having the tips
furnished with subelliptic spores, were revealed,
and an ally of the potato mould found revelling
amongst the roses.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the winter of 1863-4, we found the leaves
of several species of dock occupied by a mould
which appears to be a very low form of <i>Peronospora</i>.
Its presence was indicated by brownish orbicular
spots, on which the fertile threads occurred in
small bundles. These threads were generally
simple, but occasionally forked, bearing rather large
elliptical acrospores <i>attached obliquely</i> to the tips
of the threads (fig. 269). In consequence of this
peculiarity, we have named the species, which does
not appear to have been noticed before, <i>Peronospora
obliqua</i>. It is clearly very distinct from another
species found on dock leaves by Corda.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the remaining British species, one (<i>P.
Arenariæ</i>) is found on the leaves of the three-veined
sandwort (fig. <a href='#i160a'>268</a>); another attacks the
red corn-poppy, a third is found on the common
nettle, one on the brooklime, another on the
wood-anemone (fig. <a href='#i152b'>267</a>), and another on the figwort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless all the species in this genus are
possessed of the third means of reproduction, by
zoospores, as discovered in the potato mould, not
only from the acrospores, but also from the oospores.</p>

<p class='c008'>N.B.—Since the foregoing chapter was in type,
the Rev. M. J. Berkeley informs us that both Mr.
Broome and himself have examined the mould on
dock-leaves, to which we have given the name of
<i>Peronospora obliqua</i>, and have come to the conclusion
that it is truly a member of that genus, and
not hitherto described; but they are also of opinion
that it is the same mould as one described by Dr.
Montagne as <i>Ascomyces Rumicis</i>. We concur with
them in thinking it deficient in the important

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>NOTWITHSTANDING the inconvenience to
ourselves of calling very different fungi by
the same common name of “mildew,” the popular
mind does not recognize the inconvenience, since
it scarcely troubles itself to inquire whether they
are not all the same thing. In obedience to this
custom, we again write of “mildew,” or “blight,”
as it is called in some districts, but of a very
different kind to that which is so detrimental to
growing crops of corn. In the present instance
it is our intention to illustrate a group of fungi
which are exceedingly common, and which differ
greatly in appearance and structure from any to
which we have had occasion to allude. To obtain
a general knowledge of these forms let our reader
proceed at once to a clump of rank grass; if it is
his fortune to dwell in the country, the walk of a
few yards will suffice. Let him examine this clump
more carefully, perhaps, than he has been accustomed
to do, and we venture to predict that he
will find some of the leaves covered with what
appears to be a dirty white mould, or mildew
(<a href='#i128'>Plate XI.</a> fig. 235). One of these leaves should be
collected as carefully and conveyed to the microscope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>as speedily as possible, taking care not to touch, or
brush it against any other object so as to disturb
the arrangement of the delicate little threads upon
its surface. If a small portion, say about an inch,
is cut from this leaf with a sharp pair of scissors,
and laid upon a slide, or pinned down upon a strip
of sheet cork, so as to keep it flat, and then submitted
to examination under the microscope, with
an inch power, a beautiful forest of crystalline
vegetation will be observed. If the examiner on
this occasion should not possess a binocular microscope
we are sorry for him, because in that case he
will not see all that is to be seen under the greatest
advantages. If we ever truly enjoy looking through
such an instrument, it is on an occasion like this,
when a low power is all that is needed, and the
object is required to be seen in relief. It is scarcely
possible to convey an adequate idea of the beauty
of such a scene as the microscope reveals upon this
fragment of grass-leaf. Little bundles of delicate
threads, clear and crystalline, are seated upon a
slender branching mycelium. These threads, sometimes
erect, sometimes drooping, flexuous, or prostrate,
are composed of numerous roundish or
spherical cells attached to each other in a moniliform
or bead-like manner (fig. 236). These easily
separate from each other. Let a portion of the
threads be removed from the leaf on the point of a
lancet and laid upon a glass slide, with a thin cover
over them. Submit this object to a quarter-inch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>power, as a drop of water is let fall at the edge of
the cover and insinuates itself, by capillary attraction,
between the two plates of glass. So soon as
it touches the moniliform threads, the disunion
commences, and almost before they are enveloped
in the fluid, two spherules will scarce remain attached
to each other. This delicate little mould
on the grass leaf at one time bore the name of
<i>Oidium monilioides</i>. It is now regarded only as a
condition of another minute fungus, to which attention
will shortly be directed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vine disease, so fearfully destructive on the
Continent, and not altogether unknown in this
country, is another of these incomplete fungi.
From an individual who at the time of its first
discovery in the south of England took considerable
interest in the subject, it was called <i>Oidium
Tuckeri</i>, which name it continued to bear, both
here and abroad, until, with many others, probably
nearly all of the same genus, it was found to be
only a barren state of what is called by mycologists
an <i>Erysiphe</i>. The real discoverer of this mildew
was undoubtedly the Rev. M. J. Berkeley, who has
successfully devoted a long life to the study of
these minute organisms, through evil and through
good report, and when that study was beset with
more difficulties, and received less encouragement
than at present. If, towards the autumn, we should
again collect some whitened, mouldy, or mildewed
grass-leaves, similar in appearance to those mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>above, and carefully look at them with a
pocket lens, little black points, almost as small as
a pin-point, or more resembling the full stop with
which, this sentence closes, will be found scattered
over the white threads. The aid of the microscope
must be again sought to make out the structure of
the little black dots. Closely nestling upon the
mycelium, the little points will prove to be spherical
brownish, conceptacles, surrounded with transparent
floccose appendages. Many other species
are far more beautiful than that of the grass-leaf,
as will be seen by reference to our plate. The
variation consists chiefly in the form of the
appendages which spring from the conceptacle
and surround it in a radiating (as in figs. 219,
222, 225, and 230), or in a more or less confused
and entangled manner (as in figs. 216, 240, 245,
and 251). The surface of the conceptacle is minutely
reticulated, and its base is attached to the
mycelium. When first formed, these globose conceptacles
are almost colourless; they afterwards
acquire a yellow colour, and are ultimately of a
deep brown. The appendages are seldom at all
coloured. Within the conceptacle are contained
from one to several transparent obovoid sacs, or
spore-cases, called <i>sporangia</i>, enclosing a definite
number of spores (figs. 218, 224, 228, &amp;c.), which
vary in different species. In the hazel mildew, for
instance, there are two spores in each <i>sporangium</i>;
in the willow mildew four; in the maple mildew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>eight; in the grass mildew, and some others,
numerous. The tips of the appendages are variable,
and often elegant (figs. 227, 231, 233, 234, and
247), sometimes simple and at others symmetrically
branched. All the species occur on the still
living and green parts of plants, especially the
leaves, and are therefore truly parasitic. A pocket
lens will show whether any conceptacles are present
on any suspicious leaf which may be collected, but
high powers of the microscope are essential for
their complete examination. It is during autumn,
when vegetation begins to languish, that we shall
be most successful in searching for specimens.
They will then be found almost everywhere, and
the white mycelium forms an object too conspicuous
for them to be readily overlooked. Botanically,
nearly all the species were at one period included
in one genus, under the name of <i>Erysiphe</i>, a name
derived from the Greek, and signifying “mildew;”
at the present time they are distributed through
several genera, the chief distinctions of which are
based upon the form of the appendages. Though
personally disposed to question the generic value of
such distinctions, it would be imprudent to adopt
any other names here than those to be found in
recent English works on fungi.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first species in our enumeration is found on
cultivated roses. What a deplorable picture does
a favourite rose-bush present when attacked by this
mildew! The leaves blistered, puckered, and contorted;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>their petioles and the peduncles and calyces
of the flowers swollen, distorted, and grey with
mould; and the whole plant looking so diseased
and leprous that it needs no mycologist to tell that
the rose is mildewed. The conceptacle in this species
is minute, and contains but one sporangium,
which is one of the characters of the genus in which
it is now included, and a more justifiable distinction
than the ramifications of the appendages. The mycelium
is rather profuse, and the threads or appendages
which spring from the conceptacle are simple
and floccose (fig. 216). The sporangium contains
eight ovate spores. This species (<i>Sphærotheca
pannosa</i>, Lev.), in its oidioid or conidiiferous form,
was for some time known under the name of <i>Oidium
leucoconium</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>An allied species constitutes the hop-mildew, a
visitation with which some of our Kentish friends
are too familiar. This is not a prejudiced species
in the choice of its habitation, since it is found on
many other plants, where it flourishes with equal
vigour. The meadow-sweet, burnet, scabious,
teasle, dandelion, and other composite plants, plantain,
and plants of the cucumber family, all suffer
more or less from its roving disposition. The mycelium
of whitish threads is even more conspicuous
than in the last species, but the conceptacles are
often not to be found at all. These are also very
minute and most common on the under surface of
the leaves. The appendages, or fulcra, are simple,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>floccose (fig. 217), and coloured. The sporangia are
found singly in each conceptacle, and each, sporangium
contains eight spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>An autumnal stroll amongst hazel-bushes, when
the nuts are ripe, will lead, if the nuts are not a
greater attraction, to the discovery of whitish,
patches on the under surface of the leaves, caused
by the mycelium of the hazel mildew (<i>Phyllactinia
guttata</i>, Lev.). These patches are less distinct and
conspicuous than in many other species, but the
little blackish dots of the conceptacles may be distinguished
by sharp eyes without the use of the
lens. Though possessing a decided preference for
the hazel, this species is also found on the green
leaves of the hawthorn, ash, elm, birch, sallow,
beech, oak, and hornbeam. The conceptacles are
larger than in the two preceding species, and somewhat
depressed above. The appendages are few
(fig. 219), radiating, rigid, and acicular, or like
needles. Each conceptacle contains eight or more
sporangia, and each sporangium has from two to
four spores (fig. 220). This species being very
common, its conceptacles large, and produced
copiously, and its appendages distinct, it will
prove a good type with which the student of these
fungi may commence his examinations. This is
the only representative which we possess of the
genus established by M. Leveille for such of
the <i>Erysiphei</i> as have the conceptacle depressed,
and the appendages rigid and simple; by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>features it is distinguished from genuine species
of <i>Erysiphe</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two species, also common, having many features
agreeing with each other, are found on the leaves
of the maple and the willow. The willow blight
(<i>Uncinula adunca</i>, Lev.) is found irrespectively on
various species of poplar and willow (fig. 221). In
size and external appearances, to the unaided eye,
it seems scarcely to differ from the preceding, but
more minute examination will show that in the
appendages there is an appreciable difference.
Still rigid, but no longer aciculate, the tips bent
or curved like a little hook, or curled upon themselves
(fig. 223), radiating and numerous (fig. 222),
and at length tending upwards. Many sporangia
are contained within each conceptacle, each of
which is furnished with four spores. The amateur
must not be disappointed, if, on examining mature
conceptacles with a view to the discovery of the
sporangia, he finds only free spores. The investing
membrane is very delicate, and disappears generally
as the spores are matured.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “blight” or “mildew” which occurs on the
common hedge-maple, as well as on sycamore
leaves, is exceedingly conspicuous when occurring
on the former plant. The whole bush often presents
a hoary appearance as if sprinkled with
powdered chalk. In the spring, the under surface
of the leaves of the same plant are liable to become
hoary from another cause. The whiteness occurs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>in patches, has often a pinkish or violaceous tint,
and glistens like hoar-frost. This affection of the
leaves was, at one time, believed to be produced by
a fungus which was called <i>Erineum acerinum</i>, but
now it is regarded as a diseased state of the tissues.
In the maple mildew, both surfaces of the leaves
are alike affected, and the little, dark, point-like
conceptacles will be found studded over both. It
is not uncommon to meet with very white leaves,
caused by the mycelium, but which bear no fruit.
The appendages in this species are shorter than in
the last (fig. 225), and the tips are bifid (fig. 226),
or divided into two short branches, each of which
is bifid, and uncinate or hook-shaped (fig. 227). The
conceptacles contain not less than eight sporangia,
each of which encloses eight spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the parasites that prey upon the much
abused berberry (which has been charged in turn
with producing the mildew in corn), is one which
causes the green leaves to assume a chalky appearance
(fig. 229), though less conspicuously than in
the maple blight. This parasite is the berberry
mildew (<i>Microsphæria berberidis</i>, Lev.). In such
localities as the writer has met with the berberry
suffering from mildew, he has invariably found a
larger proportion of leaves with the barren mycelium
than of those on which the conceptacles were
developed. Perhaps in other localities this may not
be the case. The appendages, as will be seen on
reference to our plate, differ materially from any of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>those to which we have referred; indeed, this genus
(or sub-genus) has the most elaborate and beautiful
forms in these appendages of any of the Erysiphei.
A figure is given of the tip of a fulcrum from a
continental species (<i>M. Ehrenbergii</i>, Lev.), not yet
found in this country (fig. 233). In the berberry
blight the appendages are straight at the base,
but afterwards become forked, each fork being
again forked, and these yet again branched in a
similar manner (fig. 230); so that a complex dichotomous
tip is formed to each of the appendages
(fig. 231). Each conceptacle contains about six
sporangia, and each sporangium contains from six
to eight spores (fig. 232).</p>

<p class='c008'>The common gooseberry is also liable to a visitation
from an allied species, in many respects closely
similar, but differing in having the tips of the
appendages more branched, and the extremities of
the ultimate branchlets are not entire and attenuated,
as in the berberry mildew; but divided into
two toothlike processes. The conceptacles in this
species contain from four to eight sporangia, each
of which has four or five spores.</p>

<p class='c008'>In England, the leaves of the guelder-rose, and
in France (perhaps also in this country) those of
the alder, nourish a parasite belonging to this division.
This “blight” possesses so much in common
with others to which allusion has been made, that
it will scarcely be necessary to describe it in detail.
A figure of the tip of one of the appendages of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>variety found on the alder is given in the <a href='#i128'>Plate XI.</a>
fig. 234.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have found another species which had not
been before noticed in this country (<i>M. Hedwigii</i>,
Lev.), on the leaves of the mealy guelder-rose in the
vicinity of Darenth Wood, near Dartford, in Kent.
The mealy character of the leaves of this plant, and
the minute size of the conceptacles of the parasite,
render it difficult to find; indeed, it could not be
noticed unless it were sought for, as we sought it,
lens in hand. It only occurs on the under surface
of the leaves: the mycelium is very web-like and
fugacious, the conceptacles minute, globose, and
scattered (fig. 243). Four sporangia, each containing
but four spores (fig. 244), are enclosed in each
conceptacle, which is surrounded by a few appendages
(about six) thrice dichotomous, and thickened
at the tips of the ultimate branches, which are
incurved (fig. 247).</p>

<p class='c008'>The species of true <i>Erysiphe</i> are distinguished
botanically from the foregoing by the floccose
character of the appendages, in which feature they
accord with the species found on the rose and the
hop, but from which they differ in the conceptacles
containing numerous sporangia instead of only one,
as in those species.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most common and conspicuous of these
is found on the leaves and leaf-like stipules of the
garden pea. Every leaf in a crop will sometimes
suffer, and the gardener, to his great mortification,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>finds that the mildew is more prolific than his peas.
The leaves become sickly and yellow as the mycelium
of the fungus spreads over them, when they
present a peculiar appearance, as if growing beside
a chalky road in dry dusty weather, and had become
covered with comminuted chalk. Soon the conceptacles
appear, profusely scattered over the white
threads, like grains of gunpowder (fig. 237), and after
a brief struggle for existence the pea and its parasite
die together. In this species (<i>Erysiphe Martii</i>,
Lev.), the appendages are nearly transparent, short,
and much interwoven with the mycelium (fig. 238),
the globose sporangia containing from four to
eight spores (fig. 239). It is not confined to peas,
although that habitat has been here given for it,
because it is so common upon them. Beans, melilot,
St. John’s-wort, some umbelliferous plants, and the
meadow-sweet, have all been found affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The species found on grasses, especially the cocksfoot,
has been already alluded to. The conceptacles
contain from twenty to twenty-four ovate sporangia,
each enclosing eight spores. The appendages and
mycelium are much interwoven.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another of these “white mildews,” not only on
account of its frequency of occurrence on certain
plants, but also from the numerous species of
phanerogamous plants on which it is found
(fig. 240), may be truly designated “common”
(<i>Erysiphe communis</i>, Lk.); many kinds of crow-foot,
especially <i>Ranunculus acris</i>, are subject to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>parasitism. It is found also on other plants of the
same natural order, on the rest-harrow, trefoils,
enchanter’s nightshade, bindweed, and knotgrass.
There are from four to eight sporangia in each conceptacle,
containing from four to eight spores (fig.
241). In this species, more especially, M. Tulasne
found curious sucker-like processes developed on
the threads of the mycelium (fig. 242): their office
may probably be only that of attachment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the other species found in Britain an enumeration
will suffice, since they contain no feature of
interest to the microscopist; and all the members
of this section are far less beautiful than those in
other genera (especially <i>Microsphæria</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>The leaves of the dogwood or cornel (figs. 245,
246) are the home of one species (<i>E. tortilis</i>, Lk.),
and the burdock of another (<i>E. Montagnei</i>, Lev.).
Both of these, in addition to the above, have sporangia
which contain more than two spores. There
are also two species in which only two spores are
contained in each sporidium. One of these (<i>E.
Linkii</i>, Lev.) is found on both surfaces of the leaves
of the mugwort (figs. 248, 249); the other (<i>E. lamprocarpa</i>,
Lev.) occurs on salsafy, scorzonera,
weasel-snout, and plantain (figs. 250, 251).</p>

<p class='c008'>These complete the <i>Erysiphei</i>; but there are allied
species of too much interest not to be noticed in
connection with them. Three very singular fungi
are found on damp straw and paper; two on the
former and one on the latter. Of the species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>occurring on straw, the most common one is figured,
natural size, in our plate (fig. 257); but from this
no idea can be formed of its structure, which in
some points resembles an <i>Erysiphe</i>. The conceptacles
are thin and brittle, and are clothed externally
with long dark-coloured branched hairs
(figs. 258, 259). The conceptacle contains long
narrow sporangia, each enclosing dark, almost
black, lemon-shaped sporidia. For low powers
this is a very interesting object. The minute structure
affords no feature of popular interest. This
fungus (which bears the name of <i>Chætomium
elatum</i>) is common on old straw, thatch, reeds,
matting, &amp;c., resembling small brown tufts of hair,
visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>Paper much exposed to damp will occasionally
develop a similar “bristle-mould,” surrounded by
a yellowish spot (<i>Chætomium chartarum</i>, Ehrb.);
but it is not so common as the last. In habit
and structure it is very similar (figs. 252, 253).</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1838, the Rev. M. J. Berkeley announced the
discovery by him of a singular production, for
which he was unable to find a fitting location in
any genus then established, and for which he accordingly
characterized a new one, under the name
of <i>Ascotricha</i>. This new species of paper mildew
was found by him on some printed paper in a box.
It somewhat resembles the other species above
alluded to, at a casual glance; but more minute
examination will reveal its differences. The author
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to whom we are indebted for this species thus
describes its development. At first it appears as
a minute branched mould interspersed with globose
brownish conidia. As it advances in growth, globose
black peridia become visible amongst the
threads, clothed with and supported by alternately
branched obscurely-jointed filaments, the branches
of which generally form an acute angle with the
stem (fig. 254). The ramification of these is very
peculiar, the stem and main shaft of each sub-division
being almost constantly shortened and
surmounted by the branches given off near its apex;
this, again, is often abbreviated and another branchlet
given off, which again surpasses it; and occasionally
the same circumstance takes place a third
time. The apices are clavate and colourless; the
rest of the filaments, when viewed by transmitted
light, brown, even, and pellucid: a few globose
conidia are usually attached to them (fig. 255). The
conceptacle is thin, black to the naked eye, of
an olive-brown under the microscope, filled with
a mass of linear extremely transparent asci (fig. 256),
each containing a single row of broadly elliptic
chocolate sporidia. These have a paler border;
sometimes the colour entirely vanishes, either from
age or abortion, and there is only a minute globose
nucleus or more probably a vesicle of air, in the
centre; occasionally they become so transparent
that the globular bodies alone are visible. After
the conceptacles burst, several are frequently collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>together into an irregular linear body, which
consists principally of the conglomerated sporidia.</p>

<p class='c008'>One other very common and troublesome little
fungus (<i>Eurotium herbariorum</i>) will for the present
close our examples. This is found creeping
over dried plants preserved in herbaria, on
decaying fruit, preserves, and various other substances,
sometimes animal as well as vegetable,
but chiefly the latter. To the naked eye it appears
as a myriad of little yellow spherical bodies,
of the size of very small pins’ heads, resting
upon fine cobweb-like threads (fig. 260). When
magnified, the surface of the conceptacles is seen to
be reticulated (fig. 261). In the interior the sporidia
are borne, contained also, as in the former
instance, in asci. It has been considered <i>probable</i>,
but as yet not fully proved, that this mildew is
a compound fruited (ascigerous) condition of an
equally common mould (<i>Aspergillus</i>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Shortt, of Chingleput, in a recent report
on the growth and production of Indian Cotton,
remarks that the plants are subject to the
attacks of a kind of mildew. He writes:—“They
appear in the form of rounded fibres
or thallus, shooting up in the air, having the
lamina of the leaf as a base, and feeling villous to
the touch. The small fibrillæ that form the nap
appear shooting up as sharp projections when seen
by the naked eye; under the microscope they are
found to consist of pointed tubes, interspersed here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and there with minute granular cells. It first
attacks either the upper surface of the petioles, or
the margins of the leaf, gradually extending over
the lamina, and matting together the whole leaf
into a greyish-white, felty mass. At first it attacks
the young shoots and tender leaves, preventing
them from expanding. The extension of the parasite
deprives the plant of its juices, and eventually
either destroys or renders it sterile. The spores
seem to be derived from the atmosphere, and
finding the plant in a state fit to receive them,
from either the results of excessive cultivation, or
from the effects of heat and want of moisture
rendering it unhealthy, and thus favouring the
reception of the spores of the fungi. Another
variety speckles the leaves with whitish dots.
These remain separate, but the lamina is covered
with them, and in time the leaf changes colour,
becomes yellowish, and eventually dies away. This
is evidently the disease called <i>Bunt</i>, or some variety
of it, as it is seated beneath the epidermis, and
eventually the spores escape. Under the microscope
they seem to consist of small dark cells or
spots attached to a thread-like mycelium.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The writer seems certainly to have made a
mistake in its affinities, and on the faith of the
above quotation we should be more disposed to
regard it as an <i>Erysiphe</i>. It is to be hoped that
specimens of the affected leaves will be forwarded
to this country for examination.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c012'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><em class='gesperrt'><span class='small'>SUGGESTIONS.</span></em></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c013'>IF, in offering a few practical suggestions, we
either repeat ourselves, or communicate
common-place hints, those who may know already
all we shall essay to tell them will please to pardon
and pass on.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the information essential under this head
relates to collecting, examining, and preserving
microscopic fungi.</p>

<p class='c008'>Collecting does not differ, except in the objects
themselves, from any other botanical collecting.
Those who attempt it must be prepared to sacrifice
their kid gloves and patent-leather boots, to put on
waterproofs and perseverance, and come home
sometimes disappointed. The requisites for good
work are but few, and easily supplied. A strong
knife, a pocket lens, and a box or leather bag,
will be all that is really essential. But where shall
we go—and when? Hedge-banks, the sides of
ditches, borders of woods, anywhere, if the plants
are to be found on which the fungi are parasitic.
We flatter ourselves on being rather successful in
collecting, and our favourite localities have always
been the dampest places in woods, railway-banks,
and waste places. It is a great mistake to endeavour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>to go over a large tract of ground. We have
spent a whole day in a little chalkpit, which had
fallen into disuse, and grown wild. Fifty yards
into a wood is as much, as we attempt, when alone;
and a spot six yards square has afforded us occupation
for hours. It is better to examine a small
space thoroughly than to scamper on, mile after
mile, and find nothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>When? is as much to be noted as where! All
the year round we shall be sure of finding something
of interest. As soon as the last patch of
winter’s snow has melted from the ground, and
green leaves begin to unfold themselves, the search
may begin. Cluster-cups (<i>Æcidium</i>) will be the
earliest forms encountered. On the leaves of
<i>Lapsana communis</i>, and the pilewort, these will
be found before the majority of plants have burst
their buds. Henceforth, other forms will gradually
appear, until May or June. One or two species of
<i>Puccinia</i> will be seen in April or May, but from
that period until autumn, species of <i>Trichobasis</i>
will be common. In June and July the smuts
belonging to the genus <i>Ustilago</i> are most plentiful,
and from August to October <i>Puccinia</i> and its
allied genera will have the ascendant; so that from
March to October there is continually succeeding
each other some species of parasitic fungus belonging
to the Uredines. From October to March need
be no more a season of repose from the search of
these minute plants than from March to October.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>So long as the ground is not covered with snow
there will always be something to find on dead
leaves, rotten sticks, &amp;c., when there is not a green
leaf to be seen. But these belong to a section to
which we have studiously avoided all reference in
the foregoing pages.</p>

<p class='c008'>General instructions will not always apply; but
in most instances, the lowest and earliest leaves,
in which vitality appears to decline, will be most
likely to suffer from the attacks of fungi. This
rule must not be too stringently applied; the species
of <i>Æcidium</i>, for instance, will generally be found
on vigorous green leaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having found a plant infected with some rust
or brand, and by means of a pocket lens assured
yourself that it is such, although the power is
insufficient to tell what it is, collect as many leaves
as you are likely to require; place them flat one
upon the other, to prevent their curling up at the
edges, should the weather be hot, and yourself far
from home, and lay them in your box; or if you
should take in preference an old book with stiff
covers, place them separately between the leaves
of your book, and they will be in still better condition,
if you desire to preserve them. Arrived at
home with the results of your trip, proceed at once
to lay them between folds of blotting-paper, submit
them to a gentle pressure, and change the papers
daily until your leaves are dry, not forgetting to
keep a scrap of paper with each collection, stating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>date and locality, to which, after microscopical
examination, the name may be added. When
thoroughly dry, your leaves may be preserved for
reference in old envelopes, with the particulars
endorsed on the outside. Fungi on leaves will
generally be examined to the greatest advantage
in the fresh state, but if too much pressure is not
employed in the drying, it will not be difficult even
in that condition to make out their characteristic
features. Care must be taken, by changing their
position, that moulds of other kinds do not establish
themselves upon the specimens in drying,
or that when dried they do not fall a prey to <i>Eurotium
herbariorum</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it is intended to add these leaves to your
herbarium, or to form a special herbarium for them,
they should be mounted on white paper, first by
affixing one or two leaves by means of thin glue
to a paper about four inches square, on which the
name, date, and locality may be written, and
attaching several of these <i>species</i>-papers to a larger
or <i>genus</i>-paper, or by devoting each larger paper
to a species, adding in future other varieties, and
enclosing all the <i>species</i>-papers of the same genus
within a folded sheet, on which the name of the
genus is written.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have adopted, for our own herbarium, the
“foolscap” size. A sheet of paper receives within
its fold the specimens of a single species; these
are affixed to the right-hand page, when the sheet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>is open, and a small envelope is attached by its
face to the same page at the bottom, in which loose
specimens are kept for minute and special examination,
or as duplicates. When the sheet is folded,
the specific name is written at the right-hand lower
corner, or, what is better, a strip containing that
name and its number is cut from a copy of the
“Index Fungorum,” kept for the purpose, and
gummed in its place. The remainder of this page,
which is of white cartridge paper, is occupied with
memoranda referring to the species enclosed,
sketches of the spores, synonyms, references to
descriptions, &amp;c. All the species-papers of each
genus are placed together within a sheet of brown
paper, half an inch larger in each direction, with
the name of the genus written at the left-hand
corner. A piece of millboard, the size of the covers
when folded, separates each order.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a leaf, or other portion of a plant, is to be
examined under the microscope, with the view of
determining the genus and species of its parasite,
it may be fastened with small pins to a piece of
sheet cork, two or three inches square, and about
one-eighth of an inch in thickness, such as used
for lining entomological cabinets, and so placed
under a lens that it may easily be brought into
focus, and both hands left at liberty; or a dissecting
microscope may be used for the purpose. From
one of the pustules the spores may be removed on
the sharp point of a penknife, and placed in a drop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>of water on a glass slide. A thin glass cover is
placed over the drop of water, and the slide is
submitted to examination. For further satisfaction
it will often be found necessary to make carefully
a thin section of a pustule, and place this under the
microscope, a more troublesome but also much
more satisfactory method. Reference to the Appendix
will soon determine the name and position
of the fungus, provided it belongs to the section to
which this volume is devoted.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it is thought desirable to mount the spores as
permanent objects, there is no obstacle to such a
proceeding. The spores of the different species of
<i>Aregma</i>, of <i>Triphragmium</i>, and many of the <i>Pucciniæ</i>,
will be worth the trouble. We have tried
several media, and only adopted Glycerine or
Balsam; either of these, especially the former, if
the greater difficulty of securely closing can be
overcome, will answer the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be remarked that in the examination
of moulds, such as those of the genus <i>Peronospora</i>,
included in this work, if any fluid be added, the
acrospores are immediately disconnected from the
threads, and float in the medium; so that if their
mode of attachment or arrangement would be
studied, that must be achieved without the addition
of any fluid whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best methods of observing germination, the
production of zoospores, &amp;c., have been detailed
already.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Thus do we arrive at the close of the task which
we had set ourselves to perform. This fragment
of a history of microscopic fungi goes forth to
plead for students, and prepare the path for
somewhat more complete. Is it not a shame that
more than two thousand species of plants (never
mind how minute, how insignificant) should be
known to exist, and constitute a flora, in a nation
amongst the foremost in civilization, and yet be
without a complete record? It is nevertheless true
that hundreds of minute organisms, exquisite in
form, marvellous in structure, mysterious in
development, injurious to some, linked with
the existence of all, are known to flourish in
Britain without a history or description, in the
language of, or produced in, the country they
inhabit. It is also true that the descriptions, by
which they should be known, of hundreds of the
rest lie buried in a floating literature whence the
youthful and ardent student needs, not only youth
and ardour, but leisure and perseverance unlimited
to unearth them. This, however, by the way; we
may be too great dotards on our native land, and
foolish in our desire to see her in advance, and not
in the rear in scientific attainments, pursuits, and
productions of other and, perhaps, less favoured
nations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already we fear that some of our readers will
have thought our story of rust, brand, and mildew
interminable, and looked anxiously for the close.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>On the other hand, we would flatter ourselves into
the belief that some have made a new acquaintance
with these minute and mysterious forms, and
would fain know more. The groups of fungi
which we have endeavoured to illustrate have,
with but few exceptions, one feature in common,
<i>i.e.</i>, that they are parasitic on living plants. These
constitute but a small portion of the microscopical
species found in this country. To the elegant
forms of mould which inhabit decaying vegetable
substances no allusion has been made. These constitute
a fairy flora of forests and gardens with
features as varied, and fruits as multiform, as those
of the trees and flowers of the earth. The numerous,
and often marvellous, phases of low life
developed upon dead leaves and rotten sticks,
would in description occupy a far greater space
than we have devoted to our subject. Yet, for all
these, we have not spared so much as a passing
word. The treasures still left unopened are far
richer than even those we have revealed. The
gates of another world have been thrown open,
but we have scarcely passed the threshold. A
minutely and elaborately illuminated page of the
book of Nature has been turned, and we have
only perused a single line. We might traverse
the primeval forests of the new world, and explore
the unknown regions of the old, and not encounter
so much to excite our admiration, or cause our
wonder, as lies about our feet at home; marvels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>which we tread beneath our feet, or kick from our
path, because they appear to be only rotten sticks,
withered grass, and decaying leaves. All this may
appear as the dream of an enthusiast, or the ravings
of one on whom the moon has shone too often.
When Columbus spoke of a new world beyond the
seas, which he longed to seek and explore, some
believed him duped, and others called him mad.
We write of no chimerical El Dorado, we speak
of no undiscovered world, and yet we seem to
allude to wonders still unknown, because so few
have had the courage to venture upon the journey
for themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>In sober earnestness, however, let us commend
this pursuit to all who possess a microscope and
leisure to use it. It may be for a time the “pursuit
of knowledge under difficulties,” on account
of the condition of our literature on this special
subject; but many workers will produce more
readers, and good books will come when there are
more to purchase and appreciate. It is not improbable
that in more cases than have come under
our own observation, microscopists wearied of
diatoms and allied forms, or deeming themselves
in possession of all that is novel or interesting in
this direction, are seeking for a new field of labour,
and a new subject to kindle up a new enthusiasm.
To these we have advised, and to any more such
we continue to advise, that fungi should have a
fair trial. If variety is desired, here they will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>have at least 2,000 species for a knowledge of
which the microscope is essential. If they thirst
for discovery, let them be assured that here also
the earnest worker is sure to meet with such
a reward. Or if they would acquaint themselves
with the manifestations of Divine power as developed
in the most minute of created things, let
them follow such observers as Tulasne and De
Bary, and seek the “why and the wherefore” of
the phenomena of mycetal life.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there should still be any hesitation whether
there is in this pursuit sufficient of the element of
variety, for those who do not desire to pursue the
subject into its deepest scientific recesses, to
render it available for them, let them go to a
good public library, such as that of the British
Museum, and inquire for the large illustrated work
by Corda, entitled “Icones Fungorum,” or the
more recent volumes by Tulasne (Selecta Fungorum
Carpologia), and examine the figures of microscopic
fungi in either of those works, and decide for
themselves.</p>

containing water at the British Museum. (<i>W. Carruthers, F.R.S.</i>)
March, 1872. This species is most closely allied to <i>C. elatum</i>, but
much smaller and neater. It is wholly black, and without the fibrous
base of <i>C. elatum</i>. The hairs are more delicate, not having half
the diameter, and the sporidia are scarcely more than half as long
or broad. A species of <i>Polyactis</i> afterwards made its appearance
on the same mycelium on some portion of the twine left behind

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
